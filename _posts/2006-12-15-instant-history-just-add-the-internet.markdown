In [Instant Digital History](http://behind.aotw.org/2006/12/15/instant-digital-history/), Brian at _AotW_ reminds us how easy (and free!) it is to make a history website. Brian highlights the [Wethersfield in the Civil War](http://whs-ma-civilwarwc.blogspot.com/) site, which uses Blogger, as a example. The barrier for entry to the web is much lower, and keeps getting lower, making it possible for almost any historian with the motivation to put interesting, accessible history on the web. The Wethersfield site interests me too because it's an example of how a blogging tool and the blog medium have been appropriated for purposes other than blogging.
