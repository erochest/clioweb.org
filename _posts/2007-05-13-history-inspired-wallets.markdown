Simon Collison [links](http://www.colly.com/comments/made-by-paddy/) to [MadeByPaddy](http://www.madebypaddy.com/), a great shop making and selling wallets with designs from civil defense books and pamphlets from the US and UK. My favorite so far is ["Bunker,"](http://www.madebypaddy.com/page22.htm) which uses plans from 1959 for building a personal bomb shelter.
