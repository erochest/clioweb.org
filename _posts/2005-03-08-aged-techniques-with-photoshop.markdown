I found some good Photoshop tutorials for creating "aged" or "worn" looks. See below:






  * [Basic Background](http://www.letterheadfonts.com/tipsandtricks/backgrounds/index.shtml).


  * [Marble Backgrounds](http://www.letterheadfonts.com/tipsandtricks/marble/index.shtml). Using the basic background tutorial, this page shows you how to make a cracked marble background.


  * [Old-Style Cloud Effects](http://www.letterheadfonts.com/tipsandtricks/clouds/index.shtml) -- My favorite among these. The finish project is really cool.


  * [That Wiked Worn Look: The Series](http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/000024.html) -- Great set of tutorials from [Cameron Moll](http://www.cameronmoll.com).




I'm planning to use a few of these techniques as I'm designing my [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com) submission that I'm modeling on a WPA poster. I'm tentatively calling it "Tilling the Soil".
