You are to donate because you love him, believe in him. And that's just self-aggrandizement at it's finest." -- From [Making Money Online](http://www.angiemckaig.com/archives/2005/02/23/on_making_money_online/index.html), a post by [Angie McKaig](http://www.angiemckaig.com).

Like the rest of the the blogging world, I'm intrigued by [Kottke's](http://kottke.org) [move to quit his day job and focus on his blog](http://www.kottke.org/about/patron/), asking Kottke readers to support his endeavor with small donations. As can be expected from such a high-profile blogger as Kottke, his move has sparked a lot of discussion. Comments range from the skeptical to the intrigued, the supportative to the condescending.




I'd like to think of donating to Kottke as similar to donating to public radio. I'll be glad to donate to Kottke, just like I'm glad to donate to public radio and the [History News Network](http://hnn.us). But in the back of my head I do feel some expectation of "more" from Kottke, but I'm not sure what that "more" should be. I'm curious to see how this story develops.
