[John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/may#wed-09-helvetica_50) links to an interesting BBC article on the [50th birthday of Helvetica.](http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/6638423.stm) Helvetica's had a rather contentious history among designers, and has spawned a number of offshoots and clones (including the [much-maligned Arial typeface](http://www.ms-studio.com/articles.html)).




The end of the article, however, is particularly interesting to me. To conclude, the article states that "whether you use it, or choose not to, you are sending out a message." It alludes to a small degree at how much more the populace in general are "designers" or think like designers. I'm not sure I entirely agree with this, but it's interesting to think about. More broadly, it hints at how important typography is to modern culture. The historical development of typography and its uses hasn't been addressed by academic historians as far as I know. (Roland Marchand's seminal Advertising the American Dream spends only one paragraph on a superficial discussion of typography in early 20th-century advertising.)
