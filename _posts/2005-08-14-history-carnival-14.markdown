Natalie Bennett at Phobiblion has put together a great carnival. [Go check it out](http://philobiblion.blogspot.com/2005/08/history-carnival-no-14.html) and thank Natalie for being a great host!




I'll be hosting the next carnival on September 1, so take notice of any good history blogging in the next few weeks and send a note (jboggs AT gmu DOT edu) to make nominations.
