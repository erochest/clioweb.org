Spam. I hate it. The canned meat and the email variety. The one thing I love about Mac OSX's Mail application is how well you can train it to sort our spam email. But a [post at The Old New Thing](http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/16/230388.aspx) (almost two years ago) and the discovery of a [SPAM Archive](http://www.em.ca/~bruceg/spam/) by someone named Bruce has made me wonder about the historical value of spam email, blog comments, and trackbacks, and what steps (if any) are being taken to archive it. Reading Susan Strasser's _Waste and Want_ has heightened my attention to disposability in our culture. The Internet seems a medium based on disposability, especially disposable information, whether it's spam email, blog comments, or popup ads. There have been some concern from historians about the ephemeral nature of legitimate email, but little if any concern about the even more transient nature of spam. I'm not even sure that it's worth worrying about, but it has the potential to raise some interesting questions about what we save and value, what we throw away as trash spam, and what we even consider to be trash.




In the spirit of curiosity, here are a few spam archives that I found through that all-knowing power named Google:






  * [Why Spam is Bad](http://www.xtdnet.nl/paul/spam/) -- Paul Wouters personal spam statistics and archive from 1997 to 2004. Woulters's spam went from 541 emails to 95405 emails in 2004.


  * [SpamArchive.org](http://www.spamarchive.org/) -- This group asks visitors to donate their spam for research for development of anti-spam measures.


  * [Dolphinwave.org/spam/](http://www.dolphinwave.org/spam/) -- This person archived their spam emails alphabetically based on the sender. Emails are in .txt files.


  * [Stupid Spam](http://www.toastedspam.com/stupid/) -- Toastedspam.com has a searchable list of spam email from 2002-present.
