Digitalmedievalist.org ([http://digitalmedievalist.org/journal.cfm](http://digitalmedievalist.org/journal.cfm)).




Digitalmedievalist.org, a community for "medievalists working with digital media" provides news and resources to scholars, students, and the general public about medieval studies. Their free-to-read journal features seven articles that address some aspect of the current state of medieval history on the web. Two articles in particular provide good reading for anyone interested in history and new media. Peter Robinson's [Current issues in making digital editions of medieval textsor, do electronic scholarly editions have a future?](http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/article.cfm?RecID=6) makes an assessment of the current state of making digital scholarly editionsprimarily  scholarly editions of medieval primary sources such as _The Canterbury Tales_ or_Beowulf_. Robinson argues that while tools for publishing electronic editions are much more difficult to understand, tools for publishing print editions are getting easier to use.  Kathryn Wymer's [Why Universal Accessibility Should Matter to the Digital Medievalist](http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/article.cfm?RecID=7) provides a solid introduction to the necesssity of accessible, usable design for digital history projects. Other articles focus on specific digital projects, such as Hoyt N. Duggan's article [A Progress Report on the _Piers Plowman Electronic Archive_](http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/article.cfm?RecID=3), or the use of digital tools in examining specific historical questions, as Kevin Kiernan does in [The source of the Napier fragment of Alfred's _Boethius_](http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/article.cfm?RecID=5).

Each article in the journal has a similar structure. Traditional superscripted footnotes hyperlink to anchored citations at the bottom of each article. Each paragraph of the articles is numbered, which takes the place of pages in print articles and makes referencing specific passages in the articles somewhat easier. A logical next-step would be to make the pagagraph numbers anchored links, so that linking to specific paragraphs is more efficient.




While the Digial Medievalist mimics some of the features already present in online journals, the organization itself also utilizes two distinctive tools that have not been used: RSS feeds and a Wiki. The [RSS](http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/rss/rss2.cfm) feed provides up-to-date news on the Digital Medievalist organization, news in the field of medieval history and literature, and conference and journal call-for-papers. The RSS posts about the Digitalmedievalist journal itself do not include the full text of available articles are limited only to a succinct table of contents of the articles with links to each article. The [wiki](http://sql.uleth.ca/dmorgwiki/index.php) currently focuses on various terms and acronyms relevant to digital media (e.g. XML, TEI, DTD, SGML). Given the topics of articles in the inaugural issue, the wiki's focus on technical terms seems appropriate, though I hope that the Digital Medievalist expands the use of their wiki to include terms, people, places, and events that are relevant to medieval history. A wiki that includes technical and historical terms would help Digital Medievalist in their quest to bring medieval studies and new media closer together and help their readership master two fields important to the Digital Medievalist organization.




A small criticism: The designers of the website might take Kathryn Wymer's suggestion that "poor choices in the use of color and other graphic elements fail to take into account readers who are colorblind or have other visual impairments" when they decided how to style visited links in the journal's [contents](http://www.digitalmedievalist.org/journal.cfm). When one clicks on an article, then goes back to the journal contents page, the article's title link looks much like the rest of the text, with no indication of a link. Simply keeping the titled underlined, like standard links, would help.




The first issue of Digital Medievalist is a great start. I look forward to seeing how the project develops further.
