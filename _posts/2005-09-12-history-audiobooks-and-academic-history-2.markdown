I've never listened to an audiobook, let alone buy one, but I'm tempted after browsing through the rather modest History selection in the iTunes store. A few names are there that you'd expect: James McPherson, Joseph J. Ellis, William McCulloch. But a few names were on there that I didn't expect: Howard Zinn, James Loewen, Gordon Wood, Simon Schama. I don't know the costs of offering audio versions of other publications like scholarly articles, but it would seem pretty cool given the growing popularity of podcasting and offering audio content other than music. Do you think it would be worth it to, say, the Organization of American Historians to offer a downloadable audio version of their quarterly journal? Do any journals, history or otherwise, offer audio versions of articles?
