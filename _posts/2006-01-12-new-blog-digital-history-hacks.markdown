[Digital History Hacks](http://digitalhistoryhacks.blogspot.com/) is a blog just started last month by [Dr. William J.

Digital History Hacks addresses the idea that "the web is an archive that is constantly changing and effectively infinite. What kind of research techniques can historians develop to make use of it?"
