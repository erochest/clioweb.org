After a few hours wrangling with Wordpress, Register.com, and my own web host, _[Reaching Readers](http://reachingreaders.org/)_ is online and ready for consumption.




[{% img /i/reaching1.jpg Screenshot of Reaching Readers website. %}](http://reachingreaders.org) Jill still needs to write an "About Me" page, but she does have a "Favorite Books" page that I think will be updated every now and then. The pages feature in Wordpress is pretty cool...I hadn't played with it until I made Jill's blog. The blog itself will, I think, chronicle her thoughts as she reads _all_ the Newberry Medal-winning books. If you have any thoughts or expertise on the subject, you should either drop a comment here at ClioWeb or stop by her blog and leave a comment. You can also email Jill at jillboggs AT gmail DOT com, changing the AT and DOT to "@" and "." respectively.
