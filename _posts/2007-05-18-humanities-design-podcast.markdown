My first foray into podcasting: I was a guest on [Episode 5 of Digital Campus](http://digitalcampus.tv/2007/05/16/episode-06-designed-to-make-you-think/). [Dan](http://dancohen.org), [Mills](http://edwired.org), and [Tom](http://foundhistory.org) were kind enough to invite me to talk about design for digital humanities. Like my first published book review, this is my best venture into podcasting because, well, it's my first. I have to say that, after doing the podcast, I have a renewed admiration for folks who do podcasting well. The Digital Campus team is superb. I don't think I do well, but participating in this weeks podcast makes me want to get better and learn to use podcasting well. I have a follow-up post in the work that I'll publish over the weekend, but I wanted to thank the team at Digital Campus for giving me the opportunity to talk. Design for digital humanities a big topic to discuss, one that could quite possibly have its own podcast in and of itself (and one I should discuss more on this blog). Also, thanks to the indefatigable [Ken Albers](http://historiarum.org) for editing the podcast and making me sound a little better than I usually do.
