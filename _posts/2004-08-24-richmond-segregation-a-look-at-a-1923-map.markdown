I've been interested for some time in segregation laws that were enacted in Virginia in the early 20th-century. Doing research at the [Library of Virginia](http://lva.lib.va.us), I came across a map that highlighted the African-American population in Richmond in 1923.

The map beckons more questions than it answers. The bright red color used to reveal areas of African-American residential areas is prominent, but it offers no substantial information for the viewer. There is no discussion of population density or white/black ratio in the red sections or any sections of the map. There is no reference at all about the make-up of the population outside the red zones. Plenty of information is missing from this map, some unintentionally, but much of it intentionally.

I'm interested in finding out not only how city officials who created this map found their information, but also how city officials and/or others used this map in official and unofficial ways. What was the map's initial purpose? Are there others like it? Who, or what agency, was in charge of its creation? Did other cities and localities have similar maps? If so, how did they use them?
