I've been swamped with school and work. My work on my New Media minor field readings is going very slowly. For the past month I've been considering the importance of open-access publishing for historical scholarship on the web. I've read quite a bit of work by John Willinsky and John Unsworth, among others, and have been struggling to decide how best to incorporate the arguments of Lawrence Lessig into my field statement. I plan to write more about OA in the near future, after I get my (very) rough draft of my section on OA from my advisor. I'm sure it will be heavily marked with ink.




On a different note, my short documentary assignment is finished and posted on my [class weblog](http://clioweb.org/documentary/index.php/archives/short-documentary-assignment/). I composed a short documentary on the role of popular culture and the decision to intern Japanese aliens and U.S. citizens of Japanese descent during World War II. There are a few audio problems I couldn't seem to resolve, but I'll consider them carefully while I'm working on my bigger project for the class.
