The workshop, which is co-sponsored by the American Historical Association and the National History Center, will be held at George Mason University‚Äôs Arlington campus, conveniently located in metropolitan Washington, DC. Thanks to support from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, there will be no registration fee, and a limited number of fellowships are available to defray the costs of travel and lodging for graduate students and young scholars.
