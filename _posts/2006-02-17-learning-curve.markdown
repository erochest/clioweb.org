The UK National Archives have a nice site called [Learning Curve: Crime and Punishment,](http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/candp/) which provides classroom materials and primary sources on the historical contexts of committing crime, preventing crime, and punishing perpetrators from before 1450 to the 20th century.   The design is a little clunky but easy to navigate. (Hat tip to [Paperholic](http://www.paperholic.com/weblog/2006/02/crime-and-punishment/).)
