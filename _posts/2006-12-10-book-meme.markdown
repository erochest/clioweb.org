_Apparently, I can't count or read, or I'm dyslexic. I've edited this to start on the fifth sentence, not the third, and to show only three sentences, not five!_




I've been [tagged by Josh](http://www.epistemographer.com/2006/12/10/book-meme/). Here it goes:




**1. Grab the book closest to you**




Interestingly enough, I was reading a book about the web (among other things), so the book was in my hand when I got Josh's tag.




**2. Open to page 123, go down to the fifth sentence**




Mmmkay...




**3. Post the text of next 3 sentences on your blog**

> It's an intoxicating idea, and strangely fitting. After all, a guide to the entire Web should be more than just a collection of hand-crafted ratings.

**Name the book and the author**
