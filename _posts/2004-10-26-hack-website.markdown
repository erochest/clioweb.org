I've put together a [simple website](http://www.clioweb.org/hack/) for HACK, the Society for History and Computer Knowledge. This site will include news, information about HACK and its members, and information about HACK-sponsored events. We'll put a calendar of events up soon, and we're also considering installing a weblog on the site. More to come later.
