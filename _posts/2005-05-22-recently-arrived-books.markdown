Some books that I ordered from [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com)






  * Susan Strasser, _Waste and Want: A Social History of Trash_


  * Jackson Lears, _Fables of Abundance: A Cultural History of Advertising in America_


  * Lawrence Glickman, eds., _Consumer Society in American History: A Reader_


  * Daniel Horowitz, _The Morality of Spending: Attitudes Toward the Consumer Society in America, 1875-1940_


  * Suellen Hoy, _Chasing Dirt: The American Pursuit of Cleanliness_




Lots of good reading for the next few weeks. I'm including these books in my minor field survey on U.S. cultural history. I'm almost finished with a really good book by Michael Zakim, entitled _Ready-Made Democracy: A History of Men's Dress in the American Republic, 1760-1860_, which I plan to review in a post sometime this week.
