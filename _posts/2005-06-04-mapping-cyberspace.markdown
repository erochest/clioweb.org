Design Observer had an interesting post last week on [different ways people have beem mapping cyberspace and computer use](http://www.designobserver.com/archives/003155.html). Design Observer observes:




> Of course, it is the internet that has changed our perception of space, precisely because the sheer volume of interconnectivity is beyond our imagination, whether it be language-based, data-based, or community-based. Add black holes and photographs of asteroidal moons around Jupiter, and our world seems increasingly expansive. Yet, if we cannot map it, how can we understand it?




[![](/i/mouse.223.jpg)](/i/mouse.big.jpg) This image (click the thumbnail to enlarge) is a map of someone mouse movement for a week. The mouse cursor traveled an estimated 5.5 miles. Other maps include the popular tag maps (like [del.icio.us ](http://del.icio.us/tag/)or [Flickr](http://flickr.com/photos/tags/) use) and this interesting map of [email communication at the New York Times](http://winterhouse.com/blog/enron.big.jpg). One commentor also linked to [Wordcount](http://wordcount.org/main.php), which works like a heat map of the most popular words in the English language. Wordcount gets its data from the [British National Corpus](http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/).
