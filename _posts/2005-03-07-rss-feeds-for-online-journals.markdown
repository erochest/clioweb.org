[Oxford Journals Online](http://www3.oup.co.uk/jnls/) does something pretty cool with their journals: RSS feeds. Specific journals, like [The English Historical Review](http://ehr.oupjournals.org/), [American Literary History](http://alh.oupjournals.org/), and [French History](http://fh.oupjournals.org/) have RSS feeds for their current issue and for past issues.




Even though this is a great idea, there are two problems with the feeds. First, to access the journals, you need to be a subscriber (and the subscription isn't free), or get access through a subscribing institution. George Mason is a subscriber to Oxford Journals Online, which allows me to access the RSS feeds. Two, the feeds only give you the title of the articles, not the full text of the articles or even an abstract of the articles. This may be a problem on my end; I openly profess ignorance about how RSS feeds work.




The idea to have RSS feeds, however, is great. Most online journals, history or not, really aren't that easy to find and access. And the onslaught of information that comes at us on the web makes it harder to keep up with what's new. RSS feeds allow us to see when sites are updated and look at a glance to see if anything new is interesting. RSS feeds are essential to keep up with the number of blogs I read. If online journals want to compete with weblogs for attention (they are, at this point, far behind), then they need to keep up with the latest developments in web publishing. RSS feeds would be a huge help, if done correctly, for journals.
