![](/i/sign_ny.jpg)[Forgotten NY](http://www.forgotten-ny.com/) -- Some really great images of fogotten places in New York City. See especially the sections on [street scenes](http://www.forgotten-ny.com/STREET%20SCENES/STREET%20SCENES%20HOME%20PAGE/strthome.html), [old advertising](http://www.forgotten-ny.com/ADS/ADS%20HOME%20PAGE/adhome.html), and [plastered 1950s posters](http://www.forgotten-ny.com/SIGNS/tenementmuseumsigns/posters.html).




[That Certain Smile](http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:ipdH-j0F6y8J:mondediplo.com/2004/05/16photography+&hl=en) -- The Google cache version of an article in [Le Monde diplomatique](http://mondediplo.com/). (I didn't realize Google could cache the full-text of articles that are available by subscription only.) Lots to disagree with (which I'll write about later), but interesting to think about.




[Mac OS Through the Years](http://iindigo3d.com/blog/?page_id=40) -- A graphic walk down memory lane for any Mac lovers. My aunt had a Classic II that ran System 7 (I think). It still works.




[View of Glasgow and the Clyde](http://www.paperholic.com/glasgow/index.html) -- Some nice photographs from 1911.
