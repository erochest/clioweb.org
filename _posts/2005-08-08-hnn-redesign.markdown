A few of you already know that my biggest summer project has been the redesign of the History News Network. Good news: It's done, and should go live today or tomorrow.




{% img /i/hnn_screen.jpg  %}I've been working on the redesign for a better part of a month. HNN is a massive site, with a pretty intricate publishing system, so it's been a challenge moving the site away from a table-based design to a CSS based design. Little will change as far as using the site: addresses of blogs and departments have remained the same, the commenting system has remained the same. The primary goal of the redesign was graphic consistency, usability, and accessibility through web standards.




Everyone keep their fingers crossed, and when the redesign does go live and you see something that isn't working, please email me at jboggs AT gmu DOT edu, or contact me through IM (my id is jboggs22).




**UPDATE:** [HNN is live!](http://hnn.us/)
