[Shootout! the Video Game](http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=Minisite_Generic&content_type_id=51867&display_order=4&mini_id=51863) -- To accompany its popular [Shootout!](http://www.history.com/minisite.do?content_type=mini_home&mini_id=51863) television show series, the History Channel now offers a downloadable game so you can "participate in amazing 3-D recreations of the battles that shaped history." Windows only, as far as I can tell. Scenarios for the game: "New battles will be released as new episodes of Shootout! premier this season. Upcoming episodes include "
Iraq's Most Wanted: Terror at the Border," "Okinawa: The Last Battle of World War II," and "Raid on the Bataan Death Camp."" Seems like the History Channel is either branching out into new audience demographics. I'm not really sure what to think about this yet. I'd have to play the game to make a more informed comment, but it seems like this is less about learning and exploring history than it is about acquiring some kind of prosthetic memory of the events, and reveling in the events.
