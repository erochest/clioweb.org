Jonathan Dresner has composed a great History carnival this time around. [Go check it out](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/11362.html). Putting the submissions into conference panels is especially nice.




A draft of THE PAPER is due this Thursday. Dr. Zagarri liked my introduction, so that's boosted my confidence in the project. Once I finish the project I plan to put the paper somewhere on the site, perhaps in an effort to [practice](http://www.clioweb.org/archives/2004/11/10/nature-of-peer-review-in-academia-and-the-future-of-digital-scholarship/) what I [preach](http://www.clioweb.org/archives/2005/04/07/blogs-as-scholarship-part-2/). We'll see how that goes.
