I'll be away until January 2, visiting my parents and my wife's parents. I'll miss my iMac very much, but I'll have my trust old iBook with me. I'd rather avoid the internet than log on using dial-up, though I'm sure my longing for [Dooce](http://www.dooce.com), [Early Modern Notes](http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/), [SimpleBits](http://www.simplebits.com), and [Homestar Runner](http://www.homestarrunner.com) will inevitably persuade me to plug the trusty phone line in my iBook's modem.




In any event, I wish everyone a wonderful holiday and a happy new year!
