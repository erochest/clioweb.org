The second installment of my Theme-A-Day week is entitled "Letters." I bought a nice image of some hand-written letters on [istockphoto](http://istockphoto.com) and I've wanted to use the image in a design of some sort. So, here it is. Check it out on the [demo site](http://themes.clioweb.org), or [download the ZIP file](http://clioweb.org/downloads/letters.zip).
