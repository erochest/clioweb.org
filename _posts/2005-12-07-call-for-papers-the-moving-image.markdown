Call for Papers
The Moving Image
A Visual Culture Symposium and Exhibition at George Mason University
March 2, 2006

The Moving Image is a one-day symposium featuring panels of
speakers/presentations, performance, a curated exhibition of artwork
submitted specifically for the symposium, and a keynote speaker and
reception. The symposium is sponsored by a number of departments and
programs at the University.

Humans are fascinated by moving pictures, from mass media to fine art. The
moving image both informs and explains who we are. We are interested in
examining the moving image in a variety of cultural contexts. Submissions
from a broad range of disciplinary approaches, periods and media are
welcome. Faculty submissions of video and animated work (under 10 minutes)
are also welcome. (Students with moving-image submissions should respond to
the Call for Submissions to the accompanying Student Art Show.)

Please submit abstracts of no more than 300 words to elgorman@msn.com.  The
deadline for this call for papers is January 10, 2006. Completed papers
accepted for presentation are requested by February 10, 2006. Presentations,
including visuals, should be limited to 20 minutes.

We hope you will forward this announcement to your listservs for faculty,
students, and others who may be interested.
