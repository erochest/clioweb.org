if:book has posted a great [map of online communities](http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2007/05/map_of_online_communities.html). I like how USENET is represented (I believe) by an island now underwater. It would be interesting to do an historical visualization of these communities with the same map technique. How have the size and boundaries changed over time? What "countries" have acquired new territory?
