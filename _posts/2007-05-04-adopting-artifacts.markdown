Tim Compeau at Collection Resurrection writes about a great new program involving the Gananoque Museum Collections: ["Adopt an Artefact."](http://collectionresurrection.blogspot.com/2007/04/adopt-artefact-photographs.html) Interested individuals can "adopt" items in the collection for a small fee to help with preservation and display.
