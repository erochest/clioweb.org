Long ago I had ambitions of collecting old license plates. I've only got 2 old ones (1962 Oregon, 1970 Tennessee). [Kansas License Plates -- 1913 thru 2005](http://mysite.verizon.net/moore.vb/kansas.htm) makes me want to start my collecting anew. The 1951-1955 plates that resemble the actual shape of Kansas are really cool.
