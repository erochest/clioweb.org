In case you hadn't noticed, the right sidebar is up on the main page of my site. I kinda missed it, so I brought it back. I plan to make a few improvements with the links on the side, so stay tuned.




You'll also notice that the sidebar goes away on the inner pages, like the [Blogging category](http://www.clioweb.org/index.php/archives/category/blogging/) (or any category), or posts from any month in the archives. This is all thanks to the [Conditional Tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/conditional_tags) that come with Wordpress 1.5. I basically have a separate stylesheet that "hides" the sidebar with CSS; the content itself doesn't actually go away. I'm not sure if this is the best approach, so I'll be playing around with it over the next few days.




While we're talking about Wordpress, I've been curious about tagging my weblog entries instead of categories, like [MtDewVirus has been doing](http://mtdewvirus.com/archives/2005/03/25/tag-youre-it/). That's still a little ways down on my To-Do list, but I'm looking into it. It seems to be a logical progression considering that tagging information seems to be the way to go.




### Updates




04/05/05. 9:45 am: Apparently this isn't working in Firefox. I'm fixing it now.




04/05/05, 10:15 am: I switched back to a sidebar-less site, until I get this figured out.




04/05/05, 3:15 pm: I dunno why, but the site is fixed now. I deleted the files on my server and transfered archived copies back onto the server. New rule for Jeremy: When editing my site, use a test folder or some copy other than the primary file on the site. I should write these rules down somewhere, because writing them down will OBVIOUSLY make me follow them. (Sure, sure, I hear you say.)
