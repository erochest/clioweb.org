A cold/cough/sore throat had me down most of last week, and I unfortunately failed to attend the DC History conference yesterday (opted instead to sleep most of the day). Thanks to everyone who posted comments on blogging conference sessions...it's an interesting topic, one that requires a little more research, thought, and blogging on my part.
