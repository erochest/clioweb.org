I'm going to keep this fairly brief, because I've been trying to write this post for two weeks: Starting shortly after [THATCamp](http://chnm2011.thatcamp.org), I'll be leaving the [Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu) to be the Humanities Design Architect at [Scholars' Lab](http://scholarslab.org).

The mix of emotions I've had making this decision was almost overwhelming. I've been at CHNM since the Fall of 2003, and since that time have done more things as a graduate student than I could have ever imagined. [George Mason University](http://www.gmu.edu) was the only school I applied to, and I was ridiculously lucky enough to not only get in, but also get an assistantship at CHNM. Once I got here, each year was better than the <del>next</del> last! I honestly didn't quite know or appreciate how much attending Mason and working at CHNM has changed my life until I decided to leave for someplace else. I'm incredibly sad to leave CHNM, the place where I practically learned everything I know about digital humanities. But, one great thing about this move is that I'll get to keep doing the work I love, with people I'm fortunate enough to call friends and colleagues. I'll still contribute to [Omeka](http://omeka.org), thanks to the partnership CHNM and  Scholars' Lab already have thanks to a [Library of Congress initiative](http://omeka.org/blog/2011/02/15/chnm-and-scholars-lab-partner-on-omeka-neatline/). And, I'll still try to help out with [THATCamp](http://thatcamp.org) as much as possible.

But, if there is one other place in the world I'd like to work other than CHNM, it would be Scholars' Lab. I've been a fanboy of theirs for a while now, and have had some great opportunities to collaborate with them over the past few years. Their approaches to research, teaching, and service are exactly in tune with how I want to spend my career. Plus, being a country boy at heart, the lure of the Shenandoah is too strong to resist. I am very excited and honored to join Scholars' Lab, and am looking forward to all the challenges and opportunities this move will bring!
