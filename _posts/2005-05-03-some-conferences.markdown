The American Studies Graduate Students' Committee at the University of Austin, Texas is hosting a conference entitled "Defining 'American' Values." Here's [the call for papers](http://studentorgs.utexas.edu/amsgsa/2005cfp.html).




The [Virginia Forum](http://www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=145458), which will take place in April 2006, hopes to confront the lack of venues available for discussion on all aspects of Virginia history. I plan to submit a paper to this conference, either on a history of "clean-up" weeks in Virginia's cities or a shortened version of my doctoral research seminar paper.
