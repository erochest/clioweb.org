I up and went and bought _Ragged Dick_ by Horatio Alger, and I'm planning to read it tomorrow. [Mike](http://cas.gmu.edu/historyarthistory/faculty_staff/biography.php?f=4664) suggested I read it since I'm interested in nineteenth-century urban life, discussion of individual improvement, and all that. We read George Foster's _New York by Gaslight_ a few months ago, and it was...interesting. And we can't forget that weird little book _McTeague_ by Frank Norris,  which we also read this past spring. We'll see how the Alger book goes this weekend.




I also have to get back into exercising regularly. I'll admit it: I've gained over fifty pounds since I started graduate school, and I've been losing and gaining it back over the last few years. I'm not going to kid myself, or you, by saying that grad school takes up too much of my time. Even though it does take up a considerable ammount of time, I firmly believe that people make time to do what they want to do and, well, I haven't wanted to work out enough to make the time. Part of the problem is that I don't have vanity as a motivating factor because, let's face it, that's the primary motivating factor for most people who exercise. Not that it's bad or anything. Hey, it used to be my motivation, but no more. Now it has to be my health. I visited the doctor today, and I'm in good health except for my cholesterol (too much fake* chinese food). I exercised today, but it's hard to stay motivated when I don't have an iPod to listen to and when the only thing on TV at the gym is the Young and the Restless.




I'm also going to set up a weblog for Jill. She wants to read each of the [Newberry Medal](http://www.ala.org/ala/alsc/awardsscholarships/literaryawds/newberymedal/newberymedal.htm) winners and discuss them on a blog, among other things. We're still working on a good domain name, so if you have any suggestions throw them our way. I've been exploring the idea of making a blog for me and Jill, but we agreed that we're both a little too boring for that.




I'll probably end up doing none of the other things I planned to do and spend all weekend tweaking a Wordpress install and making some graphics in Photoshop for Jill's site.




Next Week: News from the [ECHO](http://echo.gmu.edu) project's [Doing Digital History Workshop](http://echo.gmu.edu/workshops/june2005/), which looks to be lots of fun for presenters and participants alike.
