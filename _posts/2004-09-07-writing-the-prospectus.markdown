Although there are a few additions I need to add, my advisor feels that my prospectus is good enough to go to the Graduate committee. This is a bit of a relief, since I've had a difficult time wrapping up my prospectus into a digestible, readable form, mostly because I lacked focus on my project. For those of you just tuning in, my field statement will address the current state of online scholarship, primarily in History, but also other disciplines.




In a way, it scares me how much I've learned about the process in the first few weeks of school. I realize that I have a long way to go to write more coherently. My biggest problem was wanting to do too many things with the field statement, like bring in a number of web design/development readings and evaluate current online scholarship based on those readings, in addition to theoretical concepts on narrative and hypertext. In short, the primary focus of my statement--the scholarship itself--became lost, at least in my first prospectus.




I think my new draft shifts the focus back to the scholarship itself: the practice of creating online scholarship. I'll use the concepts I find in my design/development readings and in my theory readings to help me evaluate current scholarship online. My bibliography will grow as the project progresses, but I think it's a solid start.
