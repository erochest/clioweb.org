[The History of Sanitary Sewers](http://www.sewerhistory.org/) has some interesting stuff. The site uses materials initially collected by Jon Schladweiler, the Historian of the Arizona Water & Pollution Control Association, covering over 5500 years. The site includes images, documents, articles, and links.
