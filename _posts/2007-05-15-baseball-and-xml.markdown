I meant to post this a while back: Two of my favorite things--baseball and XML--are used at [The Baseball Analysts](http://baseballanalysts.com) to analyze various pitching stats. See, for example, [this article](http://baseballanalysts.com/archives/2007/03/digging_through.php) discussing the Enhanced Gameday application from MLB.com. Major League Baseball provides [XML files of games](http://gd2.mlb.com/components/game/mlb/year_2006/), albeit in a rather inaccessible form. You'll have to dig deep to find specific games and players, but the stats are there for 2004 to today.
