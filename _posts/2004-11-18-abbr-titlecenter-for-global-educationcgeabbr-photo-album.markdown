After trying several different methods, I've finally found a good solution for the photo album for GMU's [Center for Global Education](http://globaled.gmu.edu). A small list of available albums is on the Center's [album page](http://globaled.gmu.edu/cgealbum.html). More pictures will be up in the near future but, in the meantime, I'd love some feedback on what people think about its organization and usability.
