I've already received a few, but feel free to send in some more. When you send something, please type something in the Subject line that refers to the History Carnival, like "History Carnival Suggestion", so I'll know it's not spam for viagra or online poker. I'll pick my brain to come up with something catchy for April Fool's, but don't expect much. If you have any ideas, feel free to throw them my way.
