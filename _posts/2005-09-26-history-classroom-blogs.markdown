[Paula Petrik](http://historytalk.typepad.com) has three classes this semester using weblogs as part of their assignments. Go visit the student blogs in [History 120: American Survey](http://archiva.net/hist120ay05/hist120ay05_groups.htm), [History 389: History of Animation](http://www.archiva.net/hist389ay05/hist389ay05_groups.htm), and [History 616: American West,](http://www.archiva.net/hist616ay05/hist616ay05_students.htm) and leave them some comments if you feel so inclined.
