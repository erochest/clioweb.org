[Elena Razlogova](http://elenarazlogova.org), former webmaster at CHNM and now an assistant professor of History at Concordia University in Montreal, and Lisa Lynch, assistant professor of Media Studes at Catholic University, have co-authored a nice article at Vectors entitled [The Guantanamobile Project](http://www.vectorsjournal.org/index.php?page=7&projectId=3). Here's their [Author's Statement](http://www.vectorsjournal.org/index.php?page=8|2&projectId=3):




> Our contribution to the Mobility issue of Vectors, The Guantanamobile Project, is both an interactive document of a topical event ÇƒÓ the detention of terror suspects at the U.S. military base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba ÇƒÓ and a consideration of the what we might call the Çƒ?uneven mobilityÇƒ? of different kinds of citizens in todayÇƒÙs globally interconnected world. Our interviews with lawyers, activists, and family members of the detainees draw attention to the legal and physical immobility of the detainees, some confined at Guantanamo since late 2001. And a second set of interviews conducted during the summer of 2004 with Americans in the Midwest and South demonstrate the difficulty of Çƒ?mobilizingÇƒ? U.S. citizens to become concerned about the situation in Guantanamo, since concern for the detainees required expanding often fixed notions of justice and human rights across the boundaries of nationality, race, and religion. 




The article is taken from their larger [Guantanamobile Project](http://guantanamobile.org/). They traveled to various cities in the U.S in an effort to "inform and collect public opinion about the U.S. detention of prisoners at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba." Along with project updates, the larger site features a "news watch" section that links to current news stories about U.S. prisoner detention in Guantanamo Bay. Video of interviews will be available soon in the [Interviews](http://guantanamobile.org/bios.php) section. The [Learn](http://guantanamobile.org/detainees.php) section provides a brief history of the camp and detention activity at Guantanamo.
