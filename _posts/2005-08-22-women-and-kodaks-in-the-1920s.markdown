Kristine Brorson at [Historiological Notes](http://historiologicalnotes.typepad.com/) pointed out a nice article entitled [Girls' Gadgets of the 1920's & 30's](http://chipchick.blogs.com/chip_chick/2005/07/girls_gadgets_o.html), which features Kodak cameras marketed to women in the 1920s and 1930s. A larger website featuring a number of early 20th-century cameras is at [Gloriously Colorful Kodaks](http://www.digitalfxinc.com/kodak/).




On the same subject, Duke University Libraries has a nice database, called Emergence of Advertising in America, which has a section on [Kodak Advertising](http://scriptorium.lib.duke.edu/dynaweb/eaa/databases/kodak/@Generic__BookView). One of my favorite ads is the "Anywhere--Everywhere" ad, below, which Kodak ran in 1920. Mike O'Malley uses this ad in one of his History 120 modules, [Understanding Advertising](http://chnm.gmu.edu/history120/20thcentury/understandingadvertising/). Marketing cameras to women based on their design seems interesting, especially in light of my post yesterday on gender and web design.
