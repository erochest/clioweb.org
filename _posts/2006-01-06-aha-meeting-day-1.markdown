The History News Network is [covering the 2006 AHA meeting](http://hnn.us/articles/20191.html) in Philadelphia. A few Cliopatriarchs [plan to be in attendance](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/20120.html) and will host a panel entitled ["Were All the World a Blog: History Bloggers and History Blogging"](http://www.historians.org/annual/2006/06program/SessionDisplay.cfm?SessionID=82). I'm looking foward to meeting some of the people whose blogs I read...should be fun!
