Things have been slow around ClioWeb for a while since I've been doing research for my doctoral research seminar paper. From here until the end of the semester I will lovingly refer to that project as THE PAPER. I have a few ideas about the paper brewing in my head that I'm planning to share in the next week or two, so prepare to be even more bored than you were without having to read any posts on here.




The next edition of the History Carnival will go on as planned tomorrow. So keep the recommendations coming in, and look for the post tomorrow.
