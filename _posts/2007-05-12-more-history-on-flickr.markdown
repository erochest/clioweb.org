In case anyone didn't know, Flickr is a great place to find people preserving and sharing all sorts of history online. Recently, Jason Kottke linked to [Ye Olde Metal Days](http://www.flickr.com/photos/umlaut555/sets/72157594493262160/detail/), a photoset of 80s metal band photos. There's also this [1962 Fallout Shelter Handbook](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wardomatic/sets/72157594417383496/) that's part of Flickr user "wardomatic's" [Vintage Things collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/wardomatic/collections/72157600058079788/). User "rocketeer" has a nice set titled [WWII](http://www.flickr.com/photos/kt/sets/112384/) that include old World War II photos found in a used book purchased for a dollar at a library. In addition to creating sets, users are also adding their photos to various public photo pools on Flickr, like [The World War II Vintage Photo Pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/worldwar2/pool/) or [The Old Photographs Pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/oldphotographs/pool/). Also, you can also browse through all the images tagged ["history."](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/history/)
