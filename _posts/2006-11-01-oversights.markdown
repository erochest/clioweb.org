[Absent from History](http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1927788,00.html) -- Guardian Unlimited article criticizing the latest Clint Eastwood movie [Flags of our Fathers](http://www.flagsofourfathers.net/) for not showing any African-American soldiers during the fight at Iwo Jima. "Nearly 900 African-Americans fought on the Japanese island but not one appears in Clint Eastwood's Oscar-tipped film, writes Dan Glaister."
