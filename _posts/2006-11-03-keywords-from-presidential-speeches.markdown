What words in presidential speeches and documents have been the most popular or most frequently used? To help answer that question, [Chirag Mehta](http://chir.ag) has created a very slick web page that generates a tag cloud for various documents created by past American presidents, called ["US Presidential Speeches Tag Cloud."](http://chir.ag/phernalia/preztags/) Historians will quickly note that, while the projects title says "presidential speeches," a number of the documents are written letters, essays, or other documents, and not speeches. Chirag says as much in the colophon below the tag cloud. That aside, the site is a really interesting look at what keywords or phrases are popular at given points in time.

It's interesting to see, in the various State of the Union addresses for instance, what words reoccur most often, which words are older(meaning words that have been used in past documents) and which words are newer. Words like "terrorist" are obviously newer (note that it's the most used word in the past four State of the Union speeches by George W. Bush), while words like "strengthen" are older. The word "appropriation" was pretty popular until FDR (FDR used "aggression" and "aggressor" a lot). It is also interesting to see what topics and issues change over time by looking at the language of the documents. "Treaty" was a pretty popular word in the late 19th century among presidents from Grant to Teddy Roosevelt, most likely referring to various treaties with Native Americans. Overall, this reveals lots of potential for new rhetorical analysis of any kind of textual historical document with this kind of graphical representation of words.
