I'm reading Henry Willis's _Etiquette, and the Usages of Society_ (New York: Dick and Fitzgerald, Publishers, 1866) as part of my dissertation research, and one passage is particularly interesting:




> Do not pick your teeth at table, except in an emergency; as however satisfactory a practice it may be to yourself, to witness it is not at all pleasant. (29)
> 
> 





I can't imagine what kind of emergency Willis is talking about. In all seriousness, though, what would be an acceptable emergency that would allow one to ignore the rules of etiquette and pick one's teeth? If there are such emergencies, did any actually occur? Does anyone have any ideas or examples?
