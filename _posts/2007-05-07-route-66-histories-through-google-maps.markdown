A **great** example of doing history with Google Maps: [America's Highway: Oral Histories of Route 66](http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&hl=en&msa=0&mssort=5&msid=103763259662194171141.000001119b4b42bf062c2) by Jay Crim and Shekar Davarya is a Google Map of the journey and subsequent oral histories Crim and Davarya conducted while traveling Route 66 in the summer of 2002. Web, we definitely need more stuff like this. I've long thought about doing a map of all the historical markers, monuments, and museums along I-66 and I-81 in Virginia (basically my trip from [Fairfax to Pound](http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&hl=en&saddr=Fairfax,+VA&daddr=Pound,+VA+24279&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=48.106236,68.203125&ie=UTF8&z=7&om=1)). A few other folks have blogged about the Route 66 map project, including the [Tulsa Preservation Commission](http://www.tulsapreservationcommission.org/blog/index.pl?e=1017) and [Programmable Web](http://www.programmableweb.com/url/6381).
