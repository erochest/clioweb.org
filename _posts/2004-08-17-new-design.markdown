For some reason, when I changed my domain from jeremyboggs.net to clioweb.org, I couldn't figure out how to redo my database from my old blog for this new one. So, I've pretty much given up on getting that stuff back, which isn't a problem anyways since I didn't have too many posts to begin with. In any case, ClioWeb is my new site.




I've started finding some interesting weblogs done by other PhD students in a variety of fields at [phdweblogs.net](http://phdweblogs.net). It references 166 weblogs, of which 6-8 are "History and Archaelogy" students. Once my site's up and running somewhat smoothly, I'll register it there.
