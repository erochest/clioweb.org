I've been playing around with some ideas about peer review and how new media has affected its impact and processes. I plan to write a conference paper on this for the [AAHC](http://www.theaahc.org/) conference in April 2005 at [Roosevelt University](http://www.roosevelt.edu/).




One of the things I'm interested in is the way that post-publication peer review processes, especially those in electronic media, provide different ways for reviewing (and, in turn, legitimizing or de-legitimizing) works of scholarship. Especially in history, pre-publication peer review is seen as a filter, a reassurance for the reader that the work they are reading is at some level "legitimate." While this notion has its values, past examples, most notably the Bellesiles controversy, have shows that the pre-publication peer-review process is not without problems. Interestingly, the post-publication peer review processes were the ones that shed light on the errors in Bellesiles's work.




Currently, the debate in history and other humanities fields focuses solely on the technology itself (especially its vices) instead of seeing the value of the ideas published in online scholarship. Most [recent debates](http://www.clioweb.org/archives/2004/09/10/blogs-as-scholarship/) about the uses of blogs as a mode for scholarly publication have focused only on the technology, not the ideas and arguments published. Of course, I agree that most if not all of the blogs currently available lack the organization and coherence that we attribute to traditional scholarship, but this is not because the technology makes it impossible; It's because we choose not to write in that manner.




It seems reasonable to think that once we see post-publication peer review as an effective and appropriate "filter" that we can better utilize digital media for publishing scholarship, and perhaps further explore the useful but modestly-used digital medium.




Just some quick, rather disorganized thoughts I've had floating around in my head. Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated.
