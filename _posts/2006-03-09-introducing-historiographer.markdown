I'm currently studying for my comprehensive exams, scheduled to be taken the week of May 22nd. To help me study, I've set up a simple web application at [Ning](http://www.ning.com), dryly titled [U.S. History Major Field Reading List](http://ushistoryreadinglist.ning.com/). Basically, its an application that lets me add a book from my reading list, pull the book's info from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com), then add comments and tags to that book "entry." I started this in an effort to help me group books into certain "themes" or historigraphical issues, using folksonomy to "tag" books with certain themes. I need to add a lot to it (I'm too busy reading!), but I thought "Hey, why not make this my own stand-alone application, broaden the features of it, and open it up to the public?" So, that's what I'm going to. Eventually.




My Ning application is open to anyone for comments, but I'd like a application that lets me, in specific fields, type in what I think are a book's thesis statement, historiographical issues, questions it addresses, methodology, et cetera, instead of lumping all of that stuff into one large comment field. Furthermore, I'd like others to add their own books and tags, and be able to look at what users across the board have input for a specific book. This online application/service will be called Historiographer. I've got a lot of different ideas for Historiographer, but I definitely won't be diving into it until after my comps. I just don't have the time to build the thing from scratch right now; way too many irons in the fire, more than should be there honestly.  I've already got the domains purchased, though they're not pointing anywhere yet. Logo ideas are always brewing in my head. In the meantime, I thought I'd open up the discussion to you, good readers (particularly the history folk): What kind of features do you think Historiographer should have? What would you like to use it for? Is it a great idea, or totally stupid? I'm gonna build it anyways, but I'd really like to have some input from you as I'm putting Historigrapher to the drawing board. Here's your chance to influence how this app grows.
