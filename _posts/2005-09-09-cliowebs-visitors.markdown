I just downloaded and installed [WP-ShortStat](http://jrm.cc/archives/blog/wp-shortstat/), a nice Wordpress plugin that displays visitor statistics for my blog. Since 1:44am this morning I've had 119 unique visitors, and I'm shocked to see that browser use the most is Internet Explorer 5.5 for Windows! I certainly didn't design for that browser, though I'll have to find a computer with it installed so I can see what it looks like (broken all to pieces I'm sure). I hope that number goes down real fast, but it makes me wonder who's reading my blog, and why they haven't updated to IE 6.
