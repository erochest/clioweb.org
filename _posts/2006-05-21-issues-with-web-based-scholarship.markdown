Paula Petrik has begun a three-part examination of [Scholarship, (X)HTML, and CSS](http://historytalk.typepad.com/basic/2006/05/scholarship_xht.html). In the wake of Manan's ["Polyglot Manifesto"](http://hnn.us/articles/25354.html), we should definitely keep up with Paula's series.
  *[(X)HTML]: Extensible Hypertext Markup Language
  *[CSS]: Cascading Style Sheets
