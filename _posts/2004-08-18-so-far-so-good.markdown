I'm fairly satisfied with the new design thus far. It still feels like the page needs a few more details though, but I'm not sure what or where. I'm pretty happy with the logo design, though I'll probably play around with the look of the quill in the next month or so. Basically I want to juxtapose traditional history (the quill) with the web medium (through the pixel-style font). It kinda worksâ€¦I guess.




Soon I'll be putting links to my other pages, especially the mini-sites I've made for the two classes I'm taking this fall, "Digital Documenting" and "Historical Scholarship and New Media." I haven't decided if I'll do separate installs of Wordpress for those two sites, or if I'll use [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com) as the blog host. I may just do one Wordpress install for the Digital Documenting class and use this site to discuss my New Media readings course.
