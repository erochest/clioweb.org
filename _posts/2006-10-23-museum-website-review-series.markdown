Interesting stuff going on at [Relaxing on the Trail](http://chnm.gmu.edu/staff/sheila/blog/). Sheila is planning to ["review one history museum site from every US state, including DC, Puerto Rico, US Virgin Islands, and Guam."](http://chnm.gmu.edu/staff/sheila/blog/2006/10/22/new-online-history-museums-survey/) The [first post in the series](http://chnm.gmu.edu/staff/sheila/blog/2006/10/22/chicago-history-museum/) (or should it be called an epic?) is on the [Chicago History Museum](http://chicagohs.org/).
