title: Send Those Carnival Nominations!
wordpress_id: '538'

---

Despite the infrequency of posting this month, I am around, and plan to host the next [History Carnival](http://historycarnival.org) on May 1. Send nominations to jeremy AT clioweb DOT org (using "Carnival Nomination" or some derivative thereof in the subject line), or use the [blog carnival submission form](http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_29.html). (I promise to have my WordPress theme working and stop using the Kubric theme by then as well.)
