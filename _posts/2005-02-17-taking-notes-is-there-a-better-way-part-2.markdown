The past few months have been spend lost in the archives and in dozens--nay, hundreds-- of scholarly monographs and articles in some vain attempt to to establish not only a historiographical and theoretical framework for my work on fear/anxiety and segregation, but also to prepare myself for that seemingly insurmountable hurdle: The Major Field Exam. In the midst of all this personal chaos, I've started to develop a fairly solid (for me anyways) methods for taking notes on secondary sources using the super-cool program [Scribe](http://chnm.gmu.edu/tools/scribe/), created by [Elena Razlogova](http://chnm.gmu.edu/courses/er/index.html).




Scribe allows you to make electronic note cards on a variety of sources, which comes in handy for many different subfields in history. For secondary sources, especially books, I've found it helpful to have three main "types" of cards:





**General Card**

    This card is a catch-all for the entire book, stating concisely the main thesis/argument of the book, the theoretical framework, the historigraphical place or contribution of the book, and the books structure, with brief summaries of each chapter.

**Chapter Card**

    Here I treat the chapter like a mini "book" by going into more detail about the chapter's main question or thesis. I also discuss the organization of the chapter, and specifically state what I think are the most important pros and cons of each chapter.

**Points Card**

    The points card is, as you may have guessed, for specific "points" that the author makes, whether about a particular source, an author's idea that I like (or dislike), or anything specific in the book that I think deserves its own card. I have three basic sections for this card: 1. An exact quote from the book that I find interesting; 2. A paraphrase of the quote, in my own words, so I make sure I understand the quote; 3. My thoughts on the quote (likes/dislikes, ways I can do something similar, et cetera).




Two really great features of Scribe is the ability to apply "keywords" to cards, allowing you to search and display cards based on certain keyword that you've attributed to the card, and the ability to "link" cards together. Thus, I can have a Points Card on, say, Eric Lott's use of cultural hegemony in _Love and Theft_ and link it to a points card I have on Antonio Gramsci's discussion of hegemony as it relates to his ideas on Marxism. Moreover, I can have a number of cards all related in some fashion to "hegemony", and I can make a keyword--hegemony--and put it in all the cards. Then, I can search the keywords and pull up a list of those cards I've specified as related to hegemony.




While this may not work for some people, it seems to be working for me (which is, I guess, the most important part). Having a web design background, hyperlinking makes sense to me, and the lack of a physical card doesn't bother me much. More than this, it's the types of cards that have helped me the most, especially in preparing for my major field exams. I can take a quick look at the General card to get an overview of the book and its relation to other works in the field. I can link cards together, making it easier to join "schools of thought" or historigraphical approaches or anything else that I think important to link. In short, this method is helping me grapple with the increasing about of literature I'm expected to know and helping me organize my research for my dissertation.
