So, I consulted that Delphic oracle known as [Google](http://www.google.com/search?q=monday+night+football+history&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official) and [found out](http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/alltimehistory.html): [September 21, 1970, and the Cleveland Browns beat the New York Jets 31-21](http://espn.go.com/abcsports/mnf/s/1970.html).
