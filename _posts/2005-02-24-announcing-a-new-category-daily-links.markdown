Instead of having interesting outside links on the right side of my weblog, I'm going to start doing what [others](http://www.kottke.org) are [doing](http://www.simplebits.com). I'm putting my outside links in my blog, as an entry in and of itself. I've been tired of the sidebar for a while and, like [Dan at SimpleBits](http://www.simplebits.com/notebook/2005/02/17/note.html), the workarounds for using the `title` attribute for descriptions of links got kinda weird. Besides, putting the links in a post themselves makes them more prominent, and indirectly motivates me to actually **find** and **read** other stuff out there.
