After trying to figure out why some comments on my site failed to show up on my blog, I decided a new install of [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) might do the trick. We'll see how that goes, but for now I have to edit some of the code to get things looking like they used to. Watch for poorly behaving PHP and CSS, each with its own set of problems.
