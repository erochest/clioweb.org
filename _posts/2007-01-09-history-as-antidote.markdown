A nice way to start off 2007: Authur Schlesinger's [Folly's Antidote](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/opinion/01schlesinger.html?ex=1325307600&en=6b576667589dd63b&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss) from the January 1 _NYT_ explains how history is "the best antidote to delusions of omnipotence and omniscience," among other things.
