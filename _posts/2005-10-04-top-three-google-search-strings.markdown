"[Google Anniversary](http://www.google.com/search?q=google+anniversary&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official)", "[how to hack a website](http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+hack+a+website&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official)" and "[hack website](http://www.google.com/search?q=hack+website&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official)". While the "google anniversary" search lists [my post on Dan's 9/11 Anniversary Google map](http://www.clioweb.org/archive/2005/09/11/911-anniversary-google-map/) (first, by the way), the last two list [my post on the HACK website](http://www.clioweb.org/archive/2004/10/26/hack-website/) I created (that's Society for History and Computer Knowledge). The people trying to figure out how to hack a website must surely be disappointed when they read my post. I just hope they don't hack my website.
