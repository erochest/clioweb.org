[Andy Foulds](http://www.andyfoulds.co.uk) created a great game called [Wordify](http://www.andyfoulds.co.uk/amusement/wordify2.htm), in which you can enter a word to see how George W. Bush might make a new word out of it. For fun, I put in the word "freedom." Here are a few of my favorite results:






  * Freedomicate


  * super-freedomically


  * freedomitically


  * freedominate




My results for "terror":






  * terroritically


  * terroricate


  * terrorification
