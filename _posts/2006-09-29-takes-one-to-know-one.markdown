[It Takes One to Know One](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/28/AR2006092801699.html) -- Tom Scheinfeldt of [Found History](http://foundhistory.org) fame takes to task a recent Washington Post editorial [criticizing blogging](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/19/AR2006091901439.html) by Robert Samuelson. I think Samuelson may simply be lashing out at bloggers because he fears for his job.
