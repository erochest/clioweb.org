The Center for History and New Media (CHNM) [has announced](http://chnm.gmu.edu/news/archives/upcoming_echo_workshop_an.php) that we are taking applications for our summer ECHO (Exploring and Collecting History Online) workshop on the practice of digital history. The workshop is July 12-15, on George Mason University's Fairfax campus. Applications are due June 8 and can be completed [at this form](http://chnm.gmu.edu/tools/surveys/3601/).




CHNM also has small ($1000) grants to help support online collecting projects that focus on the history of science, technology, and industry. Grant proposals (500 words minimum) and a C.V. are due by July 1, and should be mailed to [chnm@gmu.edu](mailto:chnm@gmu.edu) with the subject line "ECHO Grant Proposal."
