[Brother of the Fist: The Passing of Peter Norman](http://www.edgeofsports.com/2006-10-09-202/index.html) -- Very good article by David Zirin. Peter Norman was the 1968 Olympic 200m silver medalist from Australia who stood on the platform with gold and bronze medal winners Tommie Smith and John Carlos as they "raised black gloved fists smashing the sky on the medal stand in Mexico City." Norman wasn't simply an ignorant bystander: "I asked what they wanted me to do to help." (Hat Tip: Ken Albers.)
