[Evolution of Speechballoons](http://bugpowder.com/andy/e.speechballoons.evolution.html) -- Interesting look at how illustrators have depicted speech in various cartoons and other images over time. Part of [Andy's Early Comics Archive](http://bugpowder.com/andy/index.html). The site is not well-organized, but it contains **lots** of good stuff. Has anyone written or researched the depiction of speech, and other sounds, in medieval or early modern art and illustrations?
