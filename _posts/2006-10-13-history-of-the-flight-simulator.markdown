[Flight Simulator History](http://fshistory.simflight.com/fsh/index.htm) and [Old Flight Simulator Vault](http://fshistory.simflight.com/fsvault/index.htm) -- The first is an effort to chronicle the history of flight simulator software; The second is a vault of downloads of old flight simulator programs. Both sites created and maintained by Jos Grupping. Very cool!
