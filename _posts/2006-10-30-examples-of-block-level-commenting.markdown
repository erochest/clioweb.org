Some interesting work is going on with "block-level commenting," or the ability for readers/users to comment on specific portions or "blocks" of a post. Jack Slocum's [example](http://www.jackslocum.com/yui/2006/10/09/my-wordpress-comments-system-built-with-yahoo-ui-and-yahooext/) uses WordPress and the slick Yahoo! UI, while Tim Groves at Brand Spanking New offers [something similar](http://www.brandspankingnew.net/archive/2006/10/block_level_commenting.html). I can imagine lots of uses for this with footnoting/endnoting scholarly writing on the web, and with critiquing publications and preprints.
