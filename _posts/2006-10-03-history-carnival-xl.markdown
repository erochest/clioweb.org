The [fortieth edition of the History Carnival](http://www.robmacdougall.org/archives/2006/10/history_carnival_xl.php), brought to you by Rob MacDougall, embodies **exactly** why _Old is the New New_ is one of my favorite blogs to read. Very nice job, Rob. ClioWeb hosts History Carnival XLI on October 15. (XLI has a better feel to it than 41. Its like the Super Bowl.) Send nominations to jeremy [AT] clioweb [DOT] org or use the [submissions form](http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_29.html).
