![Thumbnail of George Mason University's new logo.](/i/images/gmulogo.gif)Here it is, on [this page](http://www.gmu.edu/fairfax/). Not sure if I like it. The quill is a nice idea (of course it's nice; I used it myself), but the layout of the words is funny. Not to mention the fonts used are a little odd. In any case, it's better than the old, plain, serif font logo up on the [main site](http://www.gmu.edu).
