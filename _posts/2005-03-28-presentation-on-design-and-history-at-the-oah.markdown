[Paula Petrik](http://www.archiva.net) is giving a presentation at the 2005 OAH meeting. Her presentation is entitled "Picture This! Images, Visualization, and Design in History", and she has a blog with polls on a variety of history websites. She'd like to have more poll data, so I've reprinted her request for participants below:




> Simply put, I need more folks to take a few polls; it takes all of two minutes. Readers simply need to look and vote. The polls and intro can be found here:

If readers have additional time, they might wish to make a comment or two on
the panel blog about the examples. The blog can be found here:

> Readers might even wish to read the blog comments; some of them are very funny and insightful. Readers need not comment on all of them but, if they would write a sentence or two on the examples of their choosing, I would appreciate it. But they need not feel obliged to comment.

> Thank you,  

Paula




So, if you have a few minutes to spare (or even if you don't), take a look at what Paula's put together, answer the polls, and take a look around the blog. It should be a great presentation, so if you get a chance you should also stop by her session at the OAH this year.
