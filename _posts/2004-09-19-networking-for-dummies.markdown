Besides wanting to create a post with a title like Kubrick's [greatest film](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057012/), I have also been inspired by [Kristine Brorson's](http://www.historiologicalnotes.org) [post on Networking](http://www.historiologicalnotes.org/2004/08/networking.html). Brorson has devoted a category in her weblog to her journey through the world of networking in academia. Like her (more likely, worse than her), I have had trouble networking in the history profession. I've been working on a few publications, the largest of which are two chapters in a new version of _The History Highway_, but I haven't given many conference papers, and rarely do I talk to anyone when I attend professional conferences. I think I'll start a category on networking like Brorson will hopefully force myself into pursuing opportunities to network and discuss my experience with networking.
