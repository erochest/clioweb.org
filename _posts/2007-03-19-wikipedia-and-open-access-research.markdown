John Willinsky's latest article in _First Monday_, ["What Open Access Research Can Do for Wikipedia,"](http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_3/willinsky/) argues that open access research can help make Wikipedia better. Interestingly, Willinsky finds that only two percent of the 100 entries surveyed by Willinsky cited open access research, though 60 percent of a subset of 20 entries cited research that could be found with Google Scholar. Willinsky calls upon Wikipedia users and scholars alike to contribute more to open access research and cite that research in Wikipedia articles. Specifically, "if Wikipedia were to form more of a public access point to this research and if public expectations around this 'see for yourself' posture increases," Willinsky states, "then researchers and scholars may well have a greater incentive to make their published work open access."
