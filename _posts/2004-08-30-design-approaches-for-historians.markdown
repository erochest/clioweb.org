Perusing some of my usual blog destinations, and stumbling upon some quite impressive new ones along the way, I've become interested in the various approaches and philosophies of design. I plan to put together a list of my favorite design philosophies here, in no particular order. My purpose in putting together such a page would be to illustrate some approaches that commercial web designers use that would be beneficial to academic publication on the web.




Probably my favorite among my regular visits is [Stopdesign](http://www.stopdesign.com/about/philosophy/). Creator Douglas Bowman believes that "accessible, understandable information and beauty of form can engage observers and arrest their attention."


> A confusing, poorly designed message will miss its target almost every time. In a world where information flows abundantly, our minds have developed filters to sift through the overflow of useless data. While design must appeal to the aesthetic, it must not stand in the way of delivery, cause complications, or introduce stumbling blocks. Rather, the presence of design should simplify and facilitate our everyday life, enable us to accomplish our tasks more effectively, and remind us to enjoy them along the way.

Keep in mind that design is much more that pretty pictures, fonts, and layouts. Design serves a purpose: To assist readers to understand the message, the argument, and to give readers an overall sense of the purpose of a site. Design helps us communication information, allows us to better reach our audiences, and helps us educate the public on topics and issues that interest us. Design requires good, organized information. Conversely, information requires good, organized design. Both go hand in hand. Bowman's approach lends itself very well to form and function.




Suffice to say that Stopdesign employs web standards in its own design and its other projects. Web standards facilitate the consistent presentation of information by insisting on valid, semantic markup and the separation of content (XHTML) from style (CSS). These two facets of web design are more than just buzz words used in the design community; They reflect growing attention on the need to make accessible, usable web sites for effective communication.




Historians should consider aesthetics and usability to enhance the site's overall mood, message, and usability. Things that academics take for granted in books--margins, font-sizes, line-height, chapter organization, the color of paper--are heavily considered by (good) publishers so that their books can be read effortlessly. Incidentally, those things also apply to web sites, but because historians are not involved in the technical aspects of book printing, we have little knowledge of how those facets come into play. Thus, because we as historians are not trained to notice such things, we tend to shrink away from any indication of their importance when we try to publish our ideas ourselves electronically. Publishing on the web requires more individual attention from historians to these details. Far from diluting our ideas, aesthetics can, when used effectively, enhance our ideas and arguments and make for a more pleasant reading experience.




Historians attempting to publish scholarly work and educational tools on the Web should consider the approaches of web designers like Bowman. Using valid, semantic markup makes our sites more accessible to a wider audience and helps organize our information logically. Paying attention to the aesthetics of a site makes our online publications easier to read and understand, and gives our sites more personality in the enourmous sea of information on the Web. The Web is the perfect place for historians and other academics to publish, because it facilitate the free exchange of information and encourages community and collaboration. We simply need to use the right tools.
