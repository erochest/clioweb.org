Very cool site (no title) in which someone has [layered old photos of places against modern photos](http://ace.methodcomputers.com/ghost/). Nice way to show what has changed, and what hasn't. The best one out of the bunch (IMO) is a [picture outside a dorm](http://ace.methodcomputers.com/ghost/1.html).
