The 33rd Annual Conference on Washington, D.C. Historical Studies takes place this weekend. The [schedule](http://dclibrary.org/news/Historical%20Studies%20program%202006%20pages%5B1%5D.pdf#search='33rd%20annual%20conference%20on%20d.c.%20historical%20studies') offers lots of good stuff. I'm particularly interested in one session, "Washingtonâ€™s Not-So-Gilded Age." George Mason's own  James Garber is presenting "'Foul, Repulsive, and Unsightly:' Washington, DC's Sewage Problems and Improvements, 1865-1880." during the session, a topic very much in line with my own research interests in filth and cleanliness.




This upcoming conference, as well as the fast-approaching annual conference by the American Historical Association, has had me thinking about best strategies for blogging conference sessions. Blogging conferences is nothing new: Kottke recently  [blogged PopTech](http://www.kottke.org/06/10/poptech-day-3-wrapup), Josh Greenberg [blogged notes](http://www.epistemographer.com/2006/03/11/sxsw-notes-book-digitization-and-the-revenge-of-the-librarians/) from South by Southwest last semester (as did scores of other bloggers), just to name a few examples. I plan to blog about the session this weekend, and the sessions I'll attend at the AHA. With that in mind, I'd like to come up with a few good approaches to best blog conference sessions. So, good readers of ClioWeb, do you have suggestions? Links to resources?
