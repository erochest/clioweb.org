For part of my New Media minor field statement, I'm going to survey the current state of history e-journals, using the History Journals Guide on E-Journals [here](http://www.history-journals.de/journals/hjg-ejournals.html) as a starting point. There are a lot of journals listed, so I first plan to narrow the field (for the purposes of my examination) to journals available in English (since, like most ignorant Americans, that's the only language I know), then come up with a few other ways to narrow the number down to something more manageable. Of course, there are lots of other e-journals available, some that are open access, some that are not. Devising a way to sample journals that I'll examine has proven problematic for me because I'm sure I'll miss something. Narrowing the number of journals can, it seems, cause a few not-so-insignificant problems with my study, so I've been reluctant to do so. 




One method I had considered would be to examine only journals that are still active. Thus, I wouldn't include [The Journals for Multimedia History](http://www.albany.edu/jmmh/) in my study, since its last publication year was 2000. My reluctance is omitting the JMMH stems from my opinion that quite a few articles in that journal are good and deserve to be included in my study of digital history scholarship. Plus, it seems that inactivity is in itself an important component of my study.




I've also considered narrowing the list to "actual" journals. For example, I would not include H-Net in my study, even though the [History Journals Guide to E-Journals](http://www.history-journals.de/journals/hjg-ejournals.html) lists it. I don't consider H-Net a journal, but I'm finding it difficult to "define" e-jounal in this light.




I'm putting together a database that will be available on my site for anyone interested in the study. In the meantime, if anyone has any suggestions on how I can "sample" these e-journals, feel free to comment.
