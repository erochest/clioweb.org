The [email forum for November](http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/forum.html) at [Women and World History](http://chnm.gmu.edu/wwh/) will cover Women in Africa and is moderated by Jean Allman and Marjorie Bingham. Last month's forum focused on women in world history broadly, and had some interesting discussions about source materials and teaching about women and world history.
