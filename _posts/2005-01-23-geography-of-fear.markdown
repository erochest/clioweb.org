A while back I posted about my interests in segregation law and culture, and briefly discussed a map I found. Upon further reflection on the map, and on my recent reading in the history of emotion, I've become very interested in exploring the history and geography of fear as it applied to the culture of segregation.




I'm taking a readings course this semester with Mike O'Malley, entitled "Race, Nationalism, and Fear of the 'Other'," which will not only fulfill my course requirements for my U.S. Cultural History minor field, it will also help broaden my understanding of cultural history and theory as it applies to my interest in race and the history of fear. For this week we're reading Richard Hofstadter's _The Paranoid Style in American Politics,_ which, from my intitial brief skim of the contents, seems really cool. We're also reading Louis Hartz's _The Liberal Tradition in America_ this week. Once I've read both books more closely, I'll make some further obervations here. I had planned to create a new class weblog for the readings course, but since Mike would be the only audience I decided against that.
