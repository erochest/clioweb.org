Joi Ito asks, [Is YouTube 'Web 2.0'?"](http://joi.ito.com/archives/2006/10/22/is_youtube_web_20.html) as a follow-up to a post by Lawrence Lessig, ["The Ethics of Web 2.0."](http://lessig.org/blog/archives/003570.shtml) Lessig specifically differentiates between "true sharing" and "fake sharing." For Lessig, YouTube is a "fake sharing" site because it does not allow users to download content; all traffic is directed back to YouTube, thus YouTube, not the users, essentially controls the content.
