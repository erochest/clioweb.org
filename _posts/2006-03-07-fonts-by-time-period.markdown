A few of us at the [Center](http://chnm.gmu.edu) are wondering: is there a site or other publication that lists fonts based on their relevance to a particular historical period or time frame? For example, we want to know if a particular font was used around 1920, or if another font was used in 1820. Basically, we want to determine if certain fonts are appropriate for particular time periods, geographic locations, and/or "contexts" (used in newspapers, billboards, magazines, ads, etc.).
