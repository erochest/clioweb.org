Today is my wife Jill's birthday. So, along with the big chocolate chip cookie and presents I'm giving her I thought I'd share with the world how special and wonderful my wife is.




Jill teaches sixth grade in Fairfax, and has been teaching for six years now. Each year she gives 110% to her students and her colleagues. I've never met a teacher so concerned about the well-being of students. She expresses compassion and professionalism in everything she does as a teacher. Those that know Jill are probably aware of her unbelievable work ethic. On a typical day, she works twelve to fourteen hours, running her classroom, in meetings, then after school working on lessons and assignments for the following day or week. Parents whose students are in Jill's class have no idea how lucky their kids are. Her dedication is inspiring, and I can only hope to be half the teacher that she is. 




I've pretty much dragged her across the state of Virginia as I pursued my graduate degrees, and while moving and changing scenes has been sometimes difficult she's always supported and encouraged me. I truly feel that I couldn't go on as well as I do without her.  I want to be like her in so many ways, but most of all I want to have her sense of dedication, her honesty, and her love for life. Jill always picks me up when I stumble and she has loved me unconditionally since we met nearly five years ago.




So today I'll give her some presents in some fruitless attempt to convey materially the appreciation and love I feel for her in my heart. Thank you, Jill, for sharing your life with me. Happy birthday, and I love you.
