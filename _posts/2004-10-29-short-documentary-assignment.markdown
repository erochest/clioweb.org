I've embedded my assignment in my [Documentary](http://www.clioweb.org/documentary/) class blog. Here's the [permalink](http://clioweb.org/documentary/index.php/archives/short-documentary-assignment/).




It's not much and, like my class post says, the sound is a little distorted in some areas of the film. I'm not sure why this happened. I'm currently working on a revised version of the short doc, one with better sound and transitions from one image to the next. I agree with [Paula](http://www.archiva.net) that there's too much darkness between some images, which breaks up the flow of the film.
