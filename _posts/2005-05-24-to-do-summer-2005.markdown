The spring semester has finally passed, and now I'm moving on to things to come and things that I should have done previously. I'm sure I'll have to add to this, but this is what I have on my plate for this summer so far, in order of importance:






  1. Six different projects for [CHNM](http://chnm.gmu.edu) (more on that later).


  2. My minor field statement for my History and New Media minor.


  3. My field statment for my U.S. cultural history minor.


  4. Preliminary dissertation research -- mostly secondary source reviews and some initial primary source searching.


  5. Study for my major field exam with my [partners in crime](http://jameshalabuk.net/wordpress/).


  6. Finish review of Michelle Mitchell's _Righteous Propagation_ for the _North Carolina Historical Review_.


  7. Finish review of Lisa Lindquist Dorr's _White Women, Rape, and the Power of Race in Virginia, 1900-1960_ for the [H-Net](http://h-net.org) list [H-SAWH](http://www.h-net.org/~sawh/) (Women's and Gender history in the U.S. South).


  8. Site redesign (more streamlining than anything). The code underneath this site is a real mess. And the CSS. Oh boy. I shudder to think how bloated it is.


  9. Learn more PHP/MySQL.


  10. Work on my history e-journal database. Have to learn more PHP first (see previous).


  11. Submission for the [CSS ZenGarden](http://csszengarden.com).




Not too much, but I'll certainly be busy.
