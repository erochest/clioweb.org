The latest addition to my growing list of online journals is [Flow](http://idg.communication.utexas.edu/flow/). From the [about page](http://idg.communication.utexas.edu/flow/about.php):

>Flow is an online journal of television and media studies launched in October 2004. Flow's mission is to provide a space where researchers, teachers, students, and the public can read about and discuss the changing landscape of contemporary media at the speed that media moves. 
> Flow is coordinated and edited by graduate students in the Department of Radio-Television-Film.




Some interesting articles, in the current issue and in the past issue. The articles seem a little more informal than most journal articles, but more formal than blog posts. As quoted in the blockquote above, the editors refer to Flow as an online journal, but on the homepage their also refer to it as a "critical forum." I'm not sure if these are exactly the same thing. The organization, however, is really nice, as is the layout and typography. The logo is kinda cool, tool.
