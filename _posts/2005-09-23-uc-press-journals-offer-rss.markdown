Rob Townsend alerted me to something new at [Caliber](http://caliber.ucpress.net/), the University of California Press's online home for journals. UC online journals now have RSS feeds, most of which feature an abstract of articles in the journals. Registration to view journal articles is required, but free. The full text of the articles is available in PDF format.
