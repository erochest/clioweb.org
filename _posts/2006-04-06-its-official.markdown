I take my major field exam on May 24th, at 10AM.  Only seven more weeks away. My preparation is going forward, slowly but surely. If you're wondering why I haven't posted much lately (or finished my Theme-A-Day week), that's one of many reasons why.




Another great history carnival was hosted by [Patahistory](http://patahistory.blogspot.com/2006/04/history-carnival-28.html), which I'm sure most of you have already checked out. The April 15th carnival is being held by (a)musings of a grad student, so send nominations to Rebecca at rgoetz[at]fas[dot]harvard[dot]edu or filling out a [submission form](http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_29.html). I embarassingly have about 1500 unread blog entries in my newsreader, which I'll hopefully get to read this weekend.
