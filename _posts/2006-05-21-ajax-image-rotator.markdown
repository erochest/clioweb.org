I'm hoping the good readers of ClioWeb can help me out. I'm looking for an Ajax-based image rotator that does a fade-in/fade-out effect, like the effect I've done at [Gulag: Soviet Forced Labor Camps and the Struggle for Freedom](http://gulaghistory.org/exhibits/nps/). There I use Flash (and some pretty ugly Flash at that), but I'd like to do this with JavaScript. I'd like a script that would allow me to either pull images from a database or read an XML file that lists images, and rotate through each image, fading the previous one. The techniques for doing this are out there, but I've yet to find a unified solution. I'm going to try my hand at writing one (after my exams, of course), but would love to know if something out there exists. Any ideas?
