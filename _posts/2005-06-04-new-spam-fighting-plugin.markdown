[Spam Karma 2.0](http://unknowngenius.com/blog/wordpress/spam-karma/dev/) looks like a good replacement for Kitty's Spaminator. I've been having a little trouble with Kitty's plugin, even though Sharon was kind enough to send me the latest version. [Bill C.](http://mason.gmu.edu/~wcarpent/)'s comment on my [Memorial Day](/2005/06/02/memorial-day-weekend/) post was marked as spam, and Bill was subsequentially blacklisted by the Spaminator. Since I love Bill's comments, I had to act quickly.




The Spam Karma 2.0 admin page seems pretty sweet, though I'm not sure what half of it does yet. Hopefully it will do a better job of sorting spam from valid comments. Not that Kitty's Spaminator was bad at this. The only problem I had with it was taking someone off the blacklist, like I had to do in Bill's case.
