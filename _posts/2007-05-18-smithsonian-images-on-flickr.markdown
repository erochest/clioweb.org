Right after I read [Sharon's post ](http://chnm.gmu.edu/staff/sharon/bracket/smithsonian-and-copyright/)on the Smithsonian Images site and copyright, I stumbled across this [Flickr collection](http://www.flickr.com/photos/publicresourceorg/collections/72157600214199993/) of over 6,000 images from the Smithsonian Images site that "appear to be overwhelmingly in the public domain." A memo from Public.Resource.Org [explains their rationale](http://public.resource.org/memo.2007.05.19.html).
