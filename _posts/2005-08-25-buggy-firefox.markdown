![](/i/unmatched.jpg)I recently upgraded to version 1.0.6 of Mozilla Firefox, and ever since the thing's been acting funky. The main problem has been that Firefox crunches text in links, often times running the link text into the rest of the text page. See the two images on the right. The image on the right is a screenshot of [Unmatched Style](http://www.unmatchedstyle.com), a good CSS showcase site. Notice how all the text in the links run together? I've noticed this has been taking place on almost all sites I visit in Firefox. I love Firefox, but this is driving me nuts. Has anyone else noticed this, and is there a fix for it?
