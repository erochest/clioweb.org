Sepoy at Chapati Mystery has proposed an online [South Asian Sourcebook](http://www.chapatimystery.com/archives/univercity/an_initiative.html).




> Think about it: A single, maintained, curated resourse site where you can find source materials for your courses on South Asia and where you can send your students to find resources. All of us scan/photocopy texts that we give as handouts all the times. This would create an archive of such material that is usuable by all involved.




Sepoy has offered to get everything set up, all he needs now are some contributors. Anyone who teaches South Asian history want to help? Send Sepoy a note.
