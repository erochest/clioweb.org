This morning I stumbled upon an interesting (and relatively new) personal and family history blog, [_Passing it On_](http://whenwordsmatter.typepad.com/passing_it_on/) by Larry Lehmer. Lehmer is running a nice series of posts on writing your own personal history, in the spirit of Personal History Month (which is May...I had no clue). The series starts with ["Good Morning, Class!"](http://whenwordsmatter.typepad.com/passing_it_on/2007/05/good_morning_cl.html) and currently at ["Remembers the Places where Memories were Made,"](http://whenwordsmatter.typepad.com/passing_it_on/2007/05/remembering_the.html) and all the posts help to encourage thinking and writing about personal pasts.




_Passing it On_ has inspired me to think more seriously about my own personal history and my family history. My mom is very interested in our family history, and does significant amounts of genealogical research. Additionally, all the collecting projects I've been involved with have made me realize that new digital historians also need skills as digital archivists and collectors. As academic historians, I think we sometimes forget about our own personal and family histories, but its seems like a fun and intimate way to connect to the past and to think of ourselves and our relatives as historical actors. To foster this kind of interest in personal history, I think one of my projects for my History 120 class next fall will involve students writing their own personal history or family history. This could be accomplished fairly easily through individual blog posts, over the course of the semester. Or it could be done in some way with the way-cool [Nearbie](http://nearbie.com) (which I definitely need to write about at length).




Has anyone else thought about doing personal history? What other personal and family history blogs are out there? Have you used personal history or family history in the classroom? Please share!
