To start of my own Theme-A-Day week, I present Minimology, a _really_ simple minimalist design. Since this is the first theme I've ever put together solely for the purpose of sharing with the public, I'm looking forward to hearing how others like it, and especially if there are any bugs. I've tested the theme on the major browsers (Firefox, IE, Safari, Opera) for both Mac and PC, but let me know if you run into problems. Head over to the [Demo Site](http://themes.clioweb.org) to try out Minimology and [download](http://clioweb.org/downloads/minimology.zip) the ZIP file.
