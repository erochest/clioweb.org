A $1,000 U.S. note, printed in 1890, [garnered nearly 2.3 million dollars from an art and rare currency collector in Dallas, Texas](http://www.newsvine.com/_news/2006/12/15/484335-collector-pays-23m-for-1000-billd). The bill is know as a "Grand Watermelon" because of the stripe pattern used on the zeros. A portrait of Union Major General George G. Meade is on the front.
