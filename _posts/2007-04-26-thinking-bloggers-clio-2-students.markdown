[Bill Turkel](http://digitalhistoryhacks.blogspot.com) kindly tagged me with the "Thinking Blogger" award. [Two. Months. Ago.](http://digitalhistory.uwo.ca/dhh/index.php/2007/03/06/design-for-a-kiosk-in-a-cabinet/) Yes, I'm just now getting around to doing this. I'd certainly tag Bill back with this award, but I don't think that's in the rules. Anyways, Bill, you make me think. But you probably already knew that.




I took Clio 2 from [Paula Petrik](http://archiva.net) during the Spring 2004 academic semester. (Here's the [Spring 2004 course site](http://www.archiva.net/clio2/hist697course.htm); here's the [Spring 2007 course site](http://www.archiva.net/hist697ay07/index.html).) It was the first time that she taught web design using CSS, and I loved every minute of it. I was still very new to it, but absorbed every technique I could find, read every discussion on CSS browser bugs I could find, and spent countless hours learning new things about Photoshop, video games, and plain old semantic HTML (now called [POSH](http://microformats.org/wiki/posh)). Now, three years later, Paula's class is _lightyears_ ahead of me when I took that class, and I learn news things from reading their blogs and following their journey through (more or less) the same assignments (and road bumps) that I encountered a few years ago. They help me think about things I never thought about when I took the class, and certainly motivate me to keep up my skills and continue learning.




So, I give the "Thinking Blogger Award" to students in this semester's Clio 2 class:
