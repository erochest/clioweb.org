In ["Improving Link Display for Print,"](http://alistapart.com/articles/improvingprint) Aaron Gustafson provides a good way to make hyperlinks in a web page's text appear as endnotes when the page is printed. The endnote shows the entire URL for the webpage. It would be nice if it formatted the endnote in Chicago style or other academic formatting by including the title, author, date created, date visited, and other information.
