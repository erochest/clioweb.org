[The Old, Weird America](http://www.robmacdougall.org/archives/2006/12/the_old_weird_americ.php) -- As good a teaser as anyone can write, Rob MacDougall's recent post outlines his plans to embark on "some expeditions into the old, weird America." On why he hadn't started earlier: "I think I was worried how the word â€œweirdâ€ might look to a skittish job search committee. Score 1/2 for the Tribbles of the world. But now Iâ€™m kicking myself, as I think the old, weird America--the idea and the phrase itself--is on the verge of having an Elvis moment." Go, Rob, go. Looking forward to it!
