For what it's worth, ClioWeb has gone through a few logos in the past several months. Here I showcase each one in order from first to current, and discuss what I like and don't like about each.


{% img /i/logo1.jpg The first logo for ClioWeb, which features a small pixelated quill and ClioWeb written in a font called Silkscreen. %}


Here's the first one, a simple box with a pixelated quill on the left and "ClioWeb" on the right. I had a vague idea about how to use the quill as a theme for the site, but the idea never materialized. The font I used here is called [Silkscreen](http://www.kottke.org/plus/type/silkscreen/), a font made by [Jason Kottke](http://www.kottke.org). As you'll notice throughout the current evolution of ClioWeb's logo, I've kept Silkscreen in some fashion. I like the font, and the quill, but not the font and the quill together. I also wasn't a fan of the rather dark colors.

The second ClioWeb logo was sans quill. Basically, it uses the Silkscreen font like the first logo, but it also adds the tagline "History. New Media. Design." I liked the simplicity of the logo, but I didn't like how I used Silkscreen for all the type. It seemed too, I dunno, **boring**. Instead of the quill, I used 6 squares to draw a semi-upside down "W". I don't know why, but I did. I don't think it works. That's why I canned it.

ClioWeb's third logo ditched Silkscreen for the primary text, but kept the font for the tagline. I also made "Clio" a light orange, and "Web" a dark grey. I liked the contrast in colors, but I couldn't find a good font for the "ClioWeb" text. Here I'm using a serif font, the name of which I cannot remember. I kept Silkscreen for the tagline. I like the contrast in the fonts.

Finally, we have the current logo. For the main text I used a font called Fairfax Station, created by Nick Curtis and available for free at [fontfreak.com](http://www.fontfreak.com). The tagline uses Silkscreen, but its colored with a bright orange (#cc6600). This contrasts well with the main text's dark grey color, which is #575757. Finally, I added a small logo, a bring orange box (#cc6600) with a large white "C" written in Silkscreen. To compare the two uses of Silkscreen here, I wrote the tagline at a font-size of 8px, and the large "C" at 64px.


I like the contrasts in colors and in fonts on this logo. I also like how it "dips" into the compass image just a little (4px to be exact). I may end up switching from Fairfax Station to some other serif or slab-serif font, if I can find one that I like. But I'm satisfied with this for now.
