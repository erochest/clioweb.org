James Horton, the OAH president, discusses in his [recent newsletter article](http://www.oah.org/pubs/nl/2004nov/horton.html) the dilemma that educators and public historians face when presenting what he calls "controversial history" to the public. The story that Dr. Horton highlightts about the teacher in Texas is especially sad; The teacher, after moving to a new school, felt extreme pressure from her students' parents to de-emphasize slavery as the cause of the Civil War. Now, I've never been keen on assigning any _one_ cause to any historical event, but attempts to overshadow the impact that slavery had on the Civil War accomplish nothing. People are just kidding themselves (and their kids) if they try to dilute the importance of slavery as the strongest reason for the emergence of the Civil War. Emphasizing the importance of slavery, for example, isn't "controversial" in any way; it's an integral part of the story. Leaving it out, in my opinion, is more controversial, and more detrimental to our understanding of U.S. history.
