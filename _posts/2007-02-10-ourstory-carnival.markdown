A great idea: [Ourstory Carnival](http://takingplace.org/2007/02/04/ourstory-carnival-beginning/) at _Taking Place_ seeks to "breakdown the hierarchical approach to history that only shares stories to promote patriotism and pacifism. We want to create an ever-evolving ourstory of what makes us who we are." (HT: [Sharon](http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/index.php/archives/2007/02/black-history-carnival/).)
