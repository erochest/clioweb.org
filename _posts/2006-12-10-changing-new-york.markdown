[New York Changing](http://www.themorningnews.org/archives/photography/changing_new_york/) -- Interesting photo gallery by [Douglas Levere](http://www.newyorkchanging.com/), from _The Morning News_, that shows photos from 1930s New York and today. Levere revisited parts of New York photographed by Berenice Abbott and published in her _Changing New York_(1939).
