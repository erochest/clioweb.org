The February 2005 issue of the _American Historical Review_ includes an article by Jack Censer and Lynn Hunt that discusses their latest online project, [Imaging the French Revolution](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/imaging/). The project is a collaboration of several historians who specialize in the French Revolution and visual culture 


Dr. Censer and Dr. Hunt have already put together a digital project on the French Revolution called [Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/), an educational resource that contains images, songs, maps, and secondary historical commentary. [Imaging the French Revolution](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/imaging/), however, is a venture into online collaborative scholarship, an effort not only to make revolutionary images accessible to the public, but also to see how different historians interpret the same sample of images and post their interpretations in one project.


The [Image Tool](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/imaging/imagetool.html) is really cool. Here site visitors can select any of the images available on the site and examine them with a variety of tools. Users can zoom in on the images to examine fine details. The Image Tool also gives users the ability to change the opacity of the image, make the image transparent, and layer different images to see similarities and differences in the images.




I'm not certain how the [Online Discussion ](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/imaging/discussion.html)took place. Was it by email? Instant messaging? This is actually the part of the site I find most interesting, where the real "collaboration" comes out. In fact, the [Essays](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/imaging/essays.html) section actually says that the historians involved "[profitted] from these discussions"  and used the discussions to modify the essays before actually publishing them on the site. Like weblogging, the individual historian retained his/her individual identity, but profitted from sharing their findings and being open to comments. The only difference, of course, is that unlike with weblogs posts, the public only gets to see the finished project after all the commenting and sharing is done.




I've got a few thoughts on this site, on the nature of online scholarship, the role of weblogging, and collaboration that I need to work out in future posts. In the meantime take some time to look around [Imaging the French Revolution](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/imaging/).
