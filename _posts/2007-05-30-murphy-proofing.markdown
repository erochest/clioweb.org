Those of you with my IM contact on your buddy list know that, every now and then, my status message reads "talking law down at Murphy's bar." That's a line from a [Sister Hazel song](http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/sisterhazel/anotherme.html), and the law that I'm talking about is, in fact, [Murphy's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murphy's_law). In short, Murphy's Law states that anything that can go wrong, will go wrong, if given the chance. And lately I've been giving lots of things lots of chances.





I've decided to take a break from blogging, for at least a month, maybe the rest of the summer. I am profoundly guilty of taking on more than I can manage, and I've been feeling quite overwhelmed lately. I've been frustrated because I have so many things I want to work on and participate in, but I lack the time, focus, and energy to do my best with all of those things. Even worse, I avoid those things by doing other stuff that's totally unnecessary. I feel restless, unfocused, even a bit melancholy. Right now, I need to prioritize. I need to start making some headway on other projects I have going. I need to get some perspective on what I want to accomplish, and own up to what I can't accomplish at this moment in time and move on.





I don't think I've even scratched the surface of what I want to do with blogging. I want to come back, with a renewed enthusiasm for this medium and purpose for this site. For the next few weeks, however, I need to take care of some other things.
