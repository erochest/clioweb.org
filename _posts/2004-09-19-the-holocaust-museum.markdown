As I mentioned in my previous post, my brother Justin and Justin Collins visited me this weekend. We decided to visit the [Holocaust Memorial Museum](http://www.ushmm.org/), since none of us had seen it before but always wanted to visit. It should go without saying that this is among the most intense museum experiences I've ever encountered. Of course, being an historian I'm aware of the atrocities of the Holocaust, but the museum exhibits had a submersive atmosphere that provided an in-depth reflection on the Holocaust. What




At first, I was suprised by the number of people walking through the three-leveled main exhibit, especially the relative **silence** that filled the halls as I walked with other visitors. Going to other musuems, I often encounter people talking out-loud about exhibits, elementary students running around, and "active" things of that nature. At the Holocaust Musuem, I saw or heard none of this. The atmosphere was very somber, and people rarely spoke louder than a whisper. Often I would see someone whisper in the ear of another while pointing at a particular exhibit, but most of the time I saw individuals, slowly shaking their head back and forth in utter disbelief of the accounts they were witnessing.




The distribution of space and light in the main exhibit lends itself to this kind of self-reflection. The hallways containing the exhibit materials are long and fairly narrow, discouraging quick movements and passive glances at the material on exhibit. Movement throughout the exhibit is slow, as groups of people stop to read, watch, and listen to particular segments of a presentation. The variety of media presented to exhibit visitors allows for a variety of ways to learn about the Holocaust. Film footage, secondary text printed on the wall, and artifacts from the Holocaust are used as different vehicles of information for evoking self-reflection on the part of visitors. The lighting in the halls focuses mainly on the exhibit materials, which also discourages loud talking to others and quick glances over the exhibits. The lighting is focused and has a purpose other than filling a room for people to see. The light here has the purpose of encouraging us to see a particular segment of the exhibit, focus on it, reflect on it.




This is by far the best museum I have ever visited. It was planned with purpose, and designed with the idea that visitors reflect seriously on the Holocaust. The topic itself should beckon this kind of reflection, but the museum indirectly fosters reflection through deliberate methods of presentation and organization. If you haven't visited already, you should.
