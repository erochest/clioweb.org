A couple of folks around the blogosphere have been working on articles for [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) and have some interesting observations. In "[Wikipedia and Me](http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk/2006/04/28/wikipedia-and-me/)" and "[Wikipedia and Me and a Few Other People](http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk/2006/05/07/wikipedia-and-me-and-a-few-other-people/)," Alun at [Archaeoastronomy](http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk) discusses his work on the article "[archaeoastronomy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archaeoastronomy)" and the subsequent changes to that entry. While Alun's "not a complete convert," he does think the edited article is better than the original. Alun is still critical of Wikipedia's policy dubbed [Neutral Point-of-View](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npov).




Mills Kelly at [edwired](http://chnm.gmu.edu/history/faculty/kelly/blogs/edwired/) also has some interesting observations on Wikipedia. Mills edited an entry on the [Donner Party](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donner_party) and blogged about it in "[What's for Dinner?](http://chnm.gmu.edu/history/faculty/kelly/blogs/edwired/archives/2006/04/whats_for_dinne.html)" and "[What's for Dinner? (cont'd)](http://chnm.gmu.edu/history/faculty/kelly/blogs/edwired/archives/2006/05/whats_for_dinne_1.html)." After editing the Donner Party entry to reflect recent archaeological evidence that doubts the extent that cannibalism took place among the party, someone edited the entry to make Mills's contributions more "palatable." But, Mills asks, "is this better history?"
