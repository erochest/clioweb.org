[Dan Cohen](http://dancohen.org), [Mills Kelly](http://edwired.org), and [Tom Scheinfeldt](http://foundhistory.org) have started [Digital Campus](http://digitalcampus.tv/), a podcast devoted to the pedagogical and scholarly aspects of digital humanities. Yet another example of why [CHNM](http://chnm.gmu.edu) is such a fantastic place to work. The first podcast is entitled "Wikipedia: Friend or Foe?" Definitely good stuff, so subscribe to it!
