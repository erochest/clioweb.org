For those of you who haven't heard the news on the [Omeka blog](http://omeka.org/blog/) or the [Twitter feed](http://twitter.com/omeka), the Omeka team has released the stable version of 0.10, and in the process upgraded a few plugins and created some new ones. Kris and [Dave](http://davelester.org) did some fantastic work on the MyOmeka plugin, which lets your users create accounts on your Omeka site to add personal notes and tags to items. We upgraded the Geolocation plugin to work with 0.10. Jim Safley updated popular iPaper plugin. And, I contributed a new, simple Social Bookmarking plugin that adds a configurable list of bookmarking services to the bottom of public items in your Omeka archive. There are a few more, all of which you can download on the [plugins page](http://omeka.org/add-ons/plugins)

Go check out the new stable release, download and install a few plugins, and let us know what you think!
