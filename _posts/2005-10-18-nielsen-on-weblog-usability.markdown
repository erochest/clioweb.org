Jakob Nielsen's [Weblog Usability: The Top Ten Design Mistakes](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/weblogs.html) posits 10 potential design flaws in weblogs. Some of it is useful, some of it is useless. Sharon has a [thoughtful response to the article](http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/index.php/archives/2005/10/blogging-mistakes/).




One point Nielsen makes that I disagree with is the notion that weblogs should be specialized. Nielsen writes:




> If you publish on many different topics, you're less likely to attract a loyal audience of high-value users. Busy people might visit a blog to read an entry about a topic that interests them. They're unlikely to return, however, if their target topic appears only sporadically among a massive range of postings on other topics. The only people who read everything are those with too much time on their hands (a low-value demographic).

While this may not be a bad strategy to use, I disagree that this is the best practice. Look at the history blogosphere, including [Mode for Caleb](http://modeforcaleb.blogspot.com), [Early Modern Notes](http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/), [Archaeoastronomy](http://archaeoastronomy.co.uk/), [Philobiblon](http://philobiblion.blogspot.com/) among [others](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/9665.html). What great is that these people not have different interests among each other, they publish about different things on their blogs. Blogging is as much an exercise in establishing a public voice and identity as it is a means of publication. To establish that voice and identity, it's often useful to publish on a variety of things because, I hope, we're not cogs fit into our little niches. There are times to specialize, and times to generalize, but I don't think we should base this on the opinion of one guy. This ultimately should be based on your interests and your audience. I don't want to write about just history, or just 19th-century cultural history, or about new media, or web design. I want to write about all of those things, because all of those things make up who I am, and what I do.




On a different note, it would be nice if Neilsen offered an RSS feed for site updates, because I am **not** signing up for another email newsletter. It's amusing to me that the guru of web usability uses something as unusable (and, in my opinion, outdated) as email updates.
