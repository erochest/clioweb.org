ClioWeb hosts the May 1 History Carnival, so send in your post submissions to me by email (jboggs AT gmu DOT edu) or use the [submission form at Blog Carnival](http://blogcarnival.com/bc/submit_29.html). I need more nominations, so keep sending them in! And, with [Cliopatria's blogroll](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/9665.html) now sporting over 400 history blogs, I know there must be some great stuff out there!
