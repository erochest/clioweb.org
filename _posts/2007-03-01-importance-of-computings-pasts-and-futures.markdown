[Alan Kay: The PC Must Be Revamped--Now](http://www.cioinsight.com/print_article2/0,1217,a=200162,00.asp) -- Great interview with Kay by Allan E. Alter. Among other things, Kay criticizes how computer programmers only think about the present, and not the past or future. "The things that are wrong with the Web today are due to this lack of curiosity in the computing profession. And it's very characteristic of a pop culture. Pop culture lives in the present; it doesn't really live in the future or want to know about great ideas from the past. I'm saying there's a lot of useful knowledge and wisdom out there for anybody who is curious, and who takes the time to do something other than just executing on some current plan. Cicero said, 'Who knows only his own generation remains always a child.' People who live in the present often wind up exploiting the present to an extent that it starts removing the possibility of having a future."
