For the past few weeks, a ["Design is..."](http://flickr.com/groups/designerwallpaper/pool/) meme has exploded, where designers have been creating desktops promoting what they think "design" is. In a similar spirit, I thought it would be cool to think about what "History is..." and make a desktop for it. The first thing that came to mind is "History is a Perpetual Beta." I've argued [previously on ClioWeb](http://clioweb.org/archive/2006/01/11/historians-and-web-20/), and on an [AAHC conference panel](http://past-forward.org), that history, like many Web 2.0 applications, is in a perpetual "beta," or in a constant state of testing, revision, and improvement. So, to spice up your computer's desktop:

I'm also taking requests to do a "History is..." desktop image. What do you think history is? Leave a response in the comments, or [contact me](http://clioweb.org/about/contact/). And feel free to make your own and let everyone know what and where it is!




Update: Sepoy at Chapati Mystery has created a desktop, and we created a [Flickr pool](http://www.flickr.com/groups/history-is/pool/), so if you make one and have a Flickr account, please add it to the pool!
