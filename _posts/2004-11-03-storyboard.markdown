I've posted my storyboard for Digital History Documentary [here](http://clioweb.typepad.com/photos/storyboard/). I'm sure my final documentary will look nothing like what my storyboard describes. At least I hope so. The storyboard doesn't convey a lot of the ideas I have for my documentary, ideas that I can only convey in the documentary itself.




Of all the things I've learned in the documentary class, the most important lesson is that there are numerous ways of telling a story, different "languages" that we as historians can use: visual, aural, verbal. I think our profession is growing increasingly open to using different media as primary source material, but is slow in accepting different media as a method for telling a story or making an argument. I attribute this mostly to the fact that, as graduate students, few historians are not trained to appreciate and understand a variety of media. Using the visual, aural, and verbal in concert to make a compelling story has been one of the most difficult aspects of the course, but also the most enjoyable.
