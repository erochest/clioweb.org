[Dave Lester](http://findingamerica.org) and I are pleased to announce the latest episode of [THATPodcast](http://thatpodcast.org). In this episode, we introduce [Omeka](http://omeka.org) on the heels of its [public release](http://omeka.org/blog/2008/02/20/omeka-now-public/). We're grateful that Sharon Leon and Tom Scheinfeldt, project directors for Omeka, agreed to interviews for the podcast. They provide some great commentary on what Omeka is and how it contributes to digital humanities. Dave follows the interviews with a nice screencast explaining how to set up an Omeka installation on your own server.





The Omeka development team is en route to Portland, Oregon for [code4lib, taking place February 25-28. We're [presenting Omeka on Wednesday](http://code4lib.org/conference/2008/schedule), and we're looking for to meeting new folks and sharing ideas. There are lots of other great panels, including a discussion by Jay Datema from the [NYPL Labs](http://labs.nypl.org). If you're in Portland, I'd love to meet you, so stop by after our panel to say hello! I've got Omeka stickers and bookmarks to give away. And, if you're not in Portland, you can read my reactions as the conference progresses on my [Twitter account](http://twitter.com/clioweb).
