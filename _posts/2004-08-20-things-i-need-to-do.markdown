School's about to begin soon, and I'll start back to work at the [Center](http://chnm.gmu.edu) next week. I'm looking forward to it greatly. Among other things, I want to work on some design problems with the [History 120 website](http://chnm.gmu.edu/history120/). The colors aren't doing it for me, and the tabs desparately need some work.




More than this, however, starting school again gets me motivated to do my best, learn as much as I can while I'm working on my PhD, and prepare for my academic career. A few things I plan to do this semester include:






  * Write a solid, well-defined field statement for my History and New Media minor.


  * Have fun making an informative documentary for Digital Documenting.


  * Prepare some reading lists and summary information for my major field examination (ya can't start too early, I've been told).


  * Flesh out some ideas for the Doctoral Research Seminar that I plan to take this spring.


  * Prepare a bibliography and statement of purpose for my readings class on Race in American Cultural History I'm taking this spring.




There's lots more I plan to do as well. I still need to get more acquainted with PHP, learn more about XML, and finish my dictionary entries I'm writing for two upcoming history dictionaries. I also need to work on this site. In any event, I won't be bored in the next few months. If I look bored, remind me of this post, as well as the one-hundred other things I didn't write down that I need to do.
