![Thumbnail screenshop of the cb2Bib program interface, from the Modspaces website.](/i/cb2bib_screen.jpg)From the [Modspaces website](http://www.molspaces.com/d_cb2bib-overview.php), "the cb2Bib is a tool for rapidly extracting unformatted, or unstandardized biblographic references from email alerts, journal Web pages, and PDF files." Kinda like CiteULike, from what I gather. It seems like a nice application, if I could only get it to work. I've been trying to install cb2Bib but haven't had much success. The problem isn't with the cb2Bib software, but the installation of the Qt 3.2.0 from Trolltech, which is a "comprehensive C++ application development framework." I'm not sure what exactly it does in relation to cb2Bib, but I do know that cb2Bib won't work without it, and I can't get it to install. If anyone has used this and can offer some help, feel free to comment or email me at jboggs AT gmu DOT edu. I might try to install it on my Windows box, but I'd rather try it out on my Mac because, if I can't get it to work on my Mac I probably won't use it.
