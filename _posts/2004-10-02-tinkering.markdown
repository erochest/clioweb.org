I'm extremely unsatisfied with my masthead and navigation for this site. I'll be tinkering with it for the next few days. I'm contemplating tabs for the navigation. Right now I have a pseudo-tab thing for the `#sitenav`. Basically, each link in the `#sitenav` div has a background matching the main page's background on the `hover` state, and has a permanent white background on the selected link.
