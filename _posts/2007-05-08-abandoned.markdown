[Abandoned Places](http://www.abandoned-places.com/) asks "why are abandoned places so attractive?" The site uses frames (very annoying), but it contains **fantastic** images of abandoned [factories](http://users.pandora.be/a-p/montellano-01.htm), [barracks](http://users.pandora.be/a-p/chartreuse01.htm), [airplanes](http://users.pandora.be/a-p/curacao-01.htm), and [whole towns](http://users.pandora.be/a-p/verlipack-01.htm) in various places in Europe. You may already know, from how often I link to them, that I love individual, enthusiastic projects like this. (Hat Tip: [D.
