First it was [James](http://jameshalabuk.net) and his [blog](http://jameshalabuk.net/blog/). Then it was [Orals Fixation](http://jameshalabuk.net/wordpress/). Now [Sheila Brennan](http://sheila.clioweb.org) is blogging under a subdomain of ClioWeb. Sheila is also a PhD student in history at GMU, and she's working on "material culture, memory, and history museums" over the summer.

It's awesome to be sharing some server space with some really bright people. Hopefully their blogging will nudge me into writing a little more. In any case, jump over to their blogs if you get tired of seeing the colors on this site changing every five minutes.
