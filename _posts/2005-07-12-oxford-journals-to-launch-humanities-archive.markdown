Yesterday Oxford Journals announced that it has launched its Humanities Archive of past journals, papers, and other humanities publications. From an [H-Net announcement](http://www.h-net.org/announce/show.cgi?ID=146909):




> With its earliest material dating from 1829, the Humanities Archive contains over 300,000 articles, including major papers in history, music, religion, philosophy, literary studies, and linguistics, from Volume 1 Issue 1 of each title to the end of 1995. Journals included in the project include Essays in Criticism, English Historical Review, Past & Present, and the Journal of Theological Studies.

> 
> The project forms part of Oxford JournalsÇƒÙ strategy to increase and improve access to scholarly information, by ensuring permanent electronic accessibility to journal content.
> 
> 

> 
> "With electronic information now commonplace, readers increasingly expect to find all journal content online, whether it is todayÇƒÙs cutting-edge research or concepts from the more distant past. This massive digitization process addresses this growing need for older contentÇƒÙ, said Richard Gedye, Sales and Marketing Director, Oxford Journals. He continued: ÇƒÚOur aim is two-fold: to increase the availability of important knowledge that was once previously hard to access and in danger of becoming lost; and to connect far more quickly with the people who need to read it."

> The Humanities Archive is available for purchase or on subscription from July 1, 2005.




It might be a nice archive, though I'm not sure how they're going to accomplish their two goals of increasing availability and more quickly connecting people with the information if it's subscription based. Not sure if my university will get access to it even though it already subscribes to the Oxford Journals online. If not, I wonder if they'll fork over the $38,000 to get access to it.




Here's the [Oxford Humanities Archive homepage](http://www.oxfordjournals.org/jnls/collections/humanities_archive.html).
