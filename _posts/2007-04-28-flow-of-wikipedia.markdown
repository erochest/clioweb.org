[History Flow](http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/projects/history_flow/) is a project that graphs the history of user collaboration on Wikipedia. The program tracks individual user history, the history of specific text on a page (what stays consistent, what changes over time), and the degree to which users contribute to an article.
