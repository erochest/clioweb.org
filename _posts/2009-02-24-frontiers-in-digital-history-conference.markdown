Frontiers in Digital History
The American Association for History and Computing (AAHC)
2009 Annual Conference
April 3–5, 2009

What frontiers in digital history are we only beginning to explore, or have yet to explore? What promising but under-utilized tools, techniques, and ideas exist in digital media that can help us do better history? Join the American Association for History and Computing for a lively discussion about the frontiers in doing history with digital media. This conference will be of interest to anyone charting new territory in digital history—both online and in the academic and public worlds—including museum professionals, archivists, librarians, historic preservationists, IT professionals, filmmakers, and academic historians.

Suggested topics for proposals include (but are not limited to):

   * Museums and exhibits
   * GIS
   * Aggregating history
   * Web 2.0 exhibits and archives
   * Designing and developing digital history
   * Teaching digital history
   * Visualizing the past
   * Networked Research

The conference committee encourages participants to go beyond theory and into the realm of practice through a variety of presentation formats, including:

   * Project Demonstrations and prototypes
   * Paper Presentations
   * Roundtable Discussions
   * Workshops

All presenters must be current members of the AAHC. Proposals for complete panels should include a chair. All proposals must include a 200-word abstract for each paper, along with a brief vita for each participant. Please be sure to indicate which member of the panel will serve as the contact person for future correspondence. Please include name, address, telephone number, and email address for each participant.
