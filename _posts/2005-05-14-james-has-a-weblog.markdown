My buddy James Halabuk, also a history PhD student at George Mason, has started a blog called [Just So You Know](http://jameshalabuk.net/blog/). His first post, [TV as RorschachÇƒ?](http://jameshalabuk.net/blog/?p=3) expands on his believe "that you could tell a lot about somemone by looking at their record collection (update: iPod playlist), knowing what they watch on television or at the movies, or by looking at their bookshelves." Indeed, my friend. In that spirit, here are a few of my favorites:




### Movies




[Memento](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0000640SA/qid=1116095349/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-7037457-2776646?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846) -- Basically about a guy trying to avenge the murder of his wife, but the guy suffers from short-term memory loss. Meaning he forgets things fifteen minutes after they happen.




[Snatch](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00003CXS4/qid=1116095495/sr=1-1/ref=sr_1_1/103-7037457-2776646?v=glance&s=dvd) -- Probably the only Guy Ritchie-directed movie I like, and it's one of those rare movies starring Brad Pitt that I like.




[The Matrix Trilogy](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B0002Y69NG/qid=1116096921/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/103-7037457-2776646?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846) -- I didn't like the third movie as much as the first two, but a great set of movies. The anime series is also great.




### Books




[Joseph Heller's _Catch-22_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0684833395/qid=1116095737/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-7037457-2776646?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) -- I have a place in my heart for Yossarian, the main character.




[Nancy Cohen's _Murder of Helen Jewett_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0679740759/qid=1116095905/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-7037457-2776646?v=glance&s=books&n=507846) -- In quite possibly the most entertaining, most well-researched history monograph that I've ever read, Cohen investigates the sensationalized murder of a New York prostitute in the nineteenth century.




### TV Shows




America's Funniest Home Videos -- Yup, I watch it every chance I get. There's nothing funnier to me than  people acting totally foolish and clueless.




**Seinfeld** -- I tend to identify with George. There's always some really important detail that I miss that makes something go wrong during my day, or some assumption I have that is completely wrong.




[Band of Brothers](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B00006CXSS/qid=1116097140/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1/103-7037457-2776646?v=glance&s=dvd&n=507846) -- It's really a miniseries instead of a TV show, but that's one reason why I like it. Based on Stephen Ambrose's [book of the same title](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/074322454X/qid=1116097140/sr=8-2/ref=pd_csp_2/103-7037457-2776646?v=glance&s=books&n=507846).
