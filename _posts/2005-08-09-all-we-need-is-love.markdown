The [HNN](http://hnn.us) redesign is slowly but surely getting the wrinkles ironed out. It's one thing to have the site working on a local server, and quite another to make it live. Thanks to everyone for the positive feedback, and for the suggestions to make the site more usable.




![Jill made me a nice hamburger with 'I love you' written in mustard on the bun.](/i/iloveu.jpg)The last month I feel like I've had my eyes fixed on a computer screen constantly, so it's really nice to come home to a hot meal and a nice message. I can't say enough how thoughtful and caring Jill is to me. Today I came home to a nice dinner with a sweet message. Jill's really cool. I love her very much.




This summer I've been feeling [a lot like Sharon does](http://www.earlymodernweb.org.uk/emn/index.php/archives/2005/08/over-to-you/): Starting a lot of posts and never finishing them. It's bad in Wordpress because the "save" button is right beside the "publish" button. Lately I've been hesitant to click "publish," opting instead to click "save" so I can go back to the post and add things when (or more like if) I get better ideas. I really shouldn't make this so hard.




Tonight I'm going to spend most of my time with Jill and with a book I've been wanting to read. (A book, can you imagine! A real book! With pages! Made of ... paper!).
