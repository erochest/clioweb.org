[Tom Scheinfeldt](http://foundhistory.org) emailed me a link to a nice [wiki entry on the history of RSS](http://www.yc-wiki.com/w/RSS), which in turn led to more reading on RSS's history. A few links of interest:






  * [Mark Pilgrim's "brief history of RSS from July 2000 to November 2000,"](http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/09/06/history_of_the_rss_fork) during which time RSS "forked." Pilgrim has documented lots of interesting discussions.


  * Joseph Reagle's["Web RSS (Syndication) History"](http://goatee.net/2003/rss-history.html) is a brief but detailed timeline of RSS's development.


  * WebReference.com's [The Evolution of RSS](http://www.webreference.com/authoring/languages/xml/rss/1/).


  * [Dave Riner's RSS 2.0 Political FAQ](http://backend.userland.com/davesRss2PoliticalFaq): An interview with the principle creator of RSS.
