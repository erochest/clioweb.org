The [Museee McCord Museum games section](http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/keys/games/) (The McCord Museum of Canadian History) has some very fun interactive Flash games on different periods and topics in history. In the "Mind your Manners!" section, there are games on the [Victorian period](http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/keys/games/17) and the [Roaring Twenties](http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/keys/games/18). You can also explore late 19th and early 20th-century [department stores](http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/keys/games/11) and [games and toys](http://www.mccord-museum.qc.ca/en/keys/games/12).
