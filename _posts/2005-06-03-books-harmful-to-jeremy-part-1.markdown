After seeing the quick responses to _Human Events_'s [Ten Most Harmful Books of the 19th and 20th Centuries](http://humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=7591), Ralph Luker wisely [steps back and ponders the implications of a "harmful" book](http://hnn.us/blogs/entries/12267.html). "If this is only a list of "harmful books" and we agree that there are such things ÇƒÏ if this is not a list of books to be banned ÇƒÏ then our criticism of the list should be criticism of particular choices, not of the enterprise, itself."




Since there are far smarter people out there than I who can assess the ammount of harm a book can do to society as a whole (which seems to be the goal of Luker's and the [Human Events list](http://humaneventsonline.com/article.php?id=7591)), I'm going to do something a little more modest and self-reflective. I'm going to make a list of the the books that have harmed _me_ the most, emotionally, physically, and intellectually. This will be published in a series of probably five books (a post for each), though I may add more books as my graduate studies continue.




Today's harmful (to Jeremy) book: [_Historians' Fallacies_ by David Hackett Fischer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0061315451/002-1241062-9361624?v=glance)




Is it possible, given Fischer's insane list of fallacies that historians have and can commit, to write a history that would satisfy Fischer?  While I'm sympathetic with Fischer's goals for the book, this isn't the kind of book that gets a first-year grad student to look forward to years of graduate study and the eventual dissertation. I had to read it my first year at Virginia Tech, and the message I got from this book (and from my historical methods class in general) is that **not only** is the job market for academic historians dismal, but you **also have to write history without making any of these fallacies**. The first few months after being exposed to this, my enthusiasm for history and for academia plummeted to personal lows. I was so eager and excited, coming from my undergraduate studies, to begin graduate school and become an academic historian. Reading Fischer's book, I began to wonder what the heck I was doing in grad school and if I could possibly write anything worthwhile and free of fallacy. The problem with the book for me, at the time, was that Fischer would focus on a specific fallacy like "the fallacy of indiscriminate pluralism" (p. 175), list a specific work of history that committed that fallacy, and offer no way to avoid that fallacy. The whole tone of the book seemed to be "OK, here are all these fallacies historians commit. Avoid them at all cost. And don't ask me how to avoid them." 




I've meant to go back and read _Historians' Fallacies_, but have avoided it because I have lots of other books to read or I think "I have better things to read than that dismal little book." It's a bad thing to think, and I should read it again with a more open-minded approach.  I'm sure I missed a lot of things when I first read it four years ago, but at the time it really did me more harm than good.




What about you, good reader? Have you had a similar or different experience with Fischer's _Historians' Fallacies_?
