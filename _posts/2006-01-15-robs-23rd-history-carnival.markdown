Rob at Old is the New New has posted the [23rd History Carnival](http://www.robmacdougall.org/archives/2006/01/history_carnival_23.php). A few CHNM bloggers made the cut ([Tom](http://chnm.gmu.edu/staff/scheinfeldt/foundhistory/), [Dan](http://dancohen.org), and [Sheila](http://clioweb.org/sheila/))!
