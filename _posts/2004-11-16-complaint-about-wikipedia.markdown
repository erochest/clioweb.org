[Amardeep Singh](http://www.lehigh.edu/~amsp/2004/11/wikipedia-grumbling-shirin-ebadi.html) points to an [article](http://www.techcentralstation.com/111504A.html) by Robert McHenry warning us about the potential dangers of [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page). While I share some of McHenry's concerns about Wikipedia, I hardly think that the "user who visits Wikipedia to learn about some subject, to confirm some matter of fact, is rather in the position of a visitor to a public restroom." McHenry uses the uncertainty of Alexander Hamilton's year of birth to protest the utility of the Wikipedia, among other things.




My advice to Mr. McHenry: Edit the Alexander Hamilton entry yourself, fix the errors you see, add relevant information, and help future readers in their search for accurate information.
