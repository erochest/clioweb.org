I'm _definitely_ looking forward to the release of _if:book_'s WordPress plugin [Commentpress](http://www.futureofthebook.org/blog/archives/2007/02/commentpress_update.html#comments). _if:book_ has used a nice, sophisticated system that allows for rich user comments on a paragraph-level, using [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) as a CMS. They've used the system on a few of their projects, including [The Iraq Study Group Report](http://www.futureofthebook.org/iraqreport/) and [The Future of Learning Institutions in a Digital Age](http://www.futureofthebook.org/HASTAC/learningreport/about/).
  *[CMS]: Content Management System
