[Sheila](http://chnm.gmu.edu/staff/sheila/) wonders if museums have genders, as [she finds some museum pages on MySpace with a specific gender filled out in the profile](http://chnm.gmu.edu/staff/sheila/blog/2007/01/11/gendered-museums-on-my-space/). The Warhol museum is male, while the Hamner Museum in California is female. It would be interesting to compare how all kinds of groups and institutions using MySpace use the gender field in the profile.
