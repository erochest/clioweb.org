I got the itch again to tweak some things on my site. I've mentioned my interest in tagging my posts in previous entries, and I finally found a great Wordpress plug-in that makes it simple: [Jerome's Keywords](http://vapourtrails.ca/wp-keywords). So for the last hour or so I've been trying to figure out how to get rid of all the categories I had and focus on tagging my posts. So, one summer project is going back through all of my previous posts and tagging them.




I still think that categories are useful, but I'm using them in a slightly different way. Instead of having categories on topics, I have four basic categories on the type or format of the post: Editorials, Research, Reviews, and Personal. Editorials will be posts on current events, news, et cetera. Research posts will be on, you guessed it, research. I plan for these to be "thinking out loud" kind of posts as I embark on my dissertation research (and other projects) this summer. My Reviews posts will be serious attempts at reviewing books, movies, journal articles, and websites. And, since blogging inevitably involves some kind of personal rant, I have a Personal category.




Anymore I convince myself that making changes to how my site works will motivate me to actually ADD CONTENT to the site, kinda like how I think that rearranging my desk or other workspace will give me a fresh start. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. We'll see what happens in the next few weeks. Reading through my posts I get the impression that I'm wandering aimlessly, that my blog doesn't have a definite purpose or make a contribution to the blogosphere. I hope that by giving my posts more clearly defined purposes (reviews, editiorials, research notes) that I can get a better sense of what I want to write. Thus, the title of this post"Tinkering Under the Hood"alludes not only to the structural changes of my site but also to the "tinkering" that I'm doing inside my brain.
