Charles Bailey at [DigitalKoans](http://www.escholarlypub.com/digitalkoans/) reports on an interesting discussion on the Liblicense-l listserv about [whether it's time to stop printing journals](http://www.escholarlypub.com/digitalkoans/2007/04/01/is-it-time-to-stop-printing-journals/). While Bailey agrees that the print journal is not required for reading purposes, he still finds that print journals may be needed (at least at this point) to ensure preservation of and full access to scholarship. Though Bailey observes that many libraries are dropping print journals due to cost (is access to electronic journals really cheaper?), libraries don't believe that publishers can be relied upon for preservation efforts. It seems to me that one solution, not discussed much, would be to rely on individual users or collectors instead of larger archival systems and institutions, for preservation. Is there such as thing as a "napster" for scholarship? This, of course, would require a significant change in the culture of academia in relation to its scholarship. Maybe it's not a great idea, but I'm throwing it out there anyways. Thoughts, anyone?
