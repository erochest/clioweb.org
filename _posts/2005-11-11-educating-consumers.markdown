Early twentieth-century advertising often took as its goal the education of consumers. With regard to products involved in cleanliness, advertisements urged shoppers to learn more about how to properly cleanse themselves and their environment. In addition to selling products, companies often provided pamphlets and articles on the latest scientific breakthroughs on methods for better cleansing.




The Allen Manufacturing Co. advertising the "Allen Fountain Brush and Bath Appliances for Scientific Bathing." Besides stating that the brush and bathing system is cleansing "as no other manner of bathing" for both the "morning cold bath" and the "evening warm bath," Allen Manuafacting also provided a publication entitled "The Science of the Bath: A Treatise on the Proper Use of the Bath and its Relation to Health and Beauty" by Williard E. Allen. I haven't had luck finding the treatise any any library or archive.

The second page of the ad lists specific brushes and their prices. The ad asks consumers to defer to the expertise of scientists, physicians, and specialists, who all use the brush in their respective practices.

This ad for The Home Washer include a diagram of the washing machine "to enable the reader to form an accurate idea of the principle and construction of the machine, and its many advantages over all the others.

Included in the Home Washer pamphet were directions for using the machine to remove ink from carpets, wash linens, and extract stains from silks. Additionally, the pamphlet included recipies for making appropriate soap for the machine, and for preparing starch.




Approaches in advertising in the early twentieth century are vastly different from today. It wasn't enough for companines to simply offer a product. These early ads indicate that lots of information on more than just the products themselves was required to sell the product. Did consumers want this information? Or was it something promoted by companies? Do these ads indicate a shift in the consumer demographic, from one educated in basic home and bodily maintenance to one uncertain how these products fit in or could enhance their daily lives? In what ways did mass consumerism usher in this increased fear of ignorance with regard to cleanliness? It is apparent that companies sought to educate consumers not only about their products, but also how those products fit into a world of scientific cleanliness. Deference to company and scientific expertise is expected in these ads, but whether consumered did in fact defer to that expertise is another story.
