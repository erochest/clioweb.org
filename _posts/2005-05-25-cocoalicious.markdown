If any of you use [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us) (I do. Take a look at [my bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/jeremyboggs)), then you should check out [Cocoalicious](http://www.scifihifi.com/cocoalicious/). Cocoalicious is a free, open source interface to list and view your bookmarks. I already subscribe to a few other del.icio.us feeds, so I hope to see an option in future releases of Cocoalicious that would allow me to see other del.icio.us feeds that I subscribe to. Right now I look at them in my [Sage news reader](https://addons.mozilla.org/extensions/moreinfo.php?application=firefox&category=News%20Reading&numpg=10&id=77), a Firefox extension. Great little application. Hat tip to [Josh](http://blog.epistemographer.com) for Cocoalicious.
