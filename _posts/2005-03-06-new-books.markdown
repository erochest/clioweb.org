["Historian Claims Nazis Did Nuclear Tests"](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/7090178/). Via [Kottke](http://kottke.org).




["Putting God Back Into American History,"](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/02/27/weekinreview/27kirk.html?pagewanted=1&oref=login) by David Kirkpatrick. _New York Times _(registration required but free). Via [Spinning Clio](http://cliopolitical.blogspot.com/2005/03/putting-god-back-into-american-history.html).




[The Way We Were: Coming of Age in Postwar Washington](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A4617-2005Mar3.html), a review of Barbara Holland's _When All the World Was Young_. _Washington Post_ (registration is free but required).




[The Fabric of Our Lives](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A5623-2005Mar3.html), a review by Ira Berlin of Stephen Yafa's _Big Cotton: How a Humble Fiber Created Fortunes, Wrecked Civilizations, and Put America on the Map_. _Washington Post_ (registration is free but required). I saw this book in Borders this weekend and wanted to sit down to read it. It seems to fit into the same thread as other books that use one object or product to frame their account of history. Take [Cod: A Biography of the Fish That Changed the World](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0140275010/qid=1110158888/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/102-9551072-6099316), or [_Salt: A World History_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142001619/qid=1110158888/sr=2-2/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_2/102-9551072-6099316), both by Mark Kurlansky. I read _Cod_ a few years back, and thought was alright.
