C.H.L. George is blogging about the research for her 2005 PhD thesis at [Topical Portrait Prints, 1660-1714](http://newspaperadvertisements.wordpress.com/). George's topic is, as you may have guessed from the title, topical portrait print advertisements from London newspapers in the 17th and 18th centuries. George provides information on [specific advertisements and collections consulted for the thesis](http://newspaperadvertisements.wordpress.com/advertisements-for-portrait-prints-in-london-newspapers-1660-1714/) and talks about the [benefits of blogging a PhD](http://newspaperadvertisements.wordpress.com/2007/01/09/benefits-of-blogging-a-phd/) after graduating. (Namely, the opportunity to reflect and reevaluate your work.)
