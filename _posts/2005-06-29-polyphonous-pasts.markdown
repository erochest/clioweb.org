I had set up a blog for Kevin Shupe on the ClioWeb server a while back and had forgotten about it, until Sheila noticed.

Presenting [Polyphonous Pasts](http://kevin.clioweb.org/), a weblog that explores the idea of polyphonous pasts, or the idea that ["multiple unresolved narratives can be woven together to produce a historical view that is more self-reflective." ](http://clioweb.org/kevin/?page_id=3)Good luck, Kevin, and welcome to the blogosphere.
