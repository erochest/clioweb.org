Just a quick thought that I need to turn into something more nuanced:




I recently read Tara McPherson's [Flow](http://flowtv.org)article, ["What Color Is Your Scholarship?,"](http://jot.communication.utexas.edu/flow/?jot=view&id=1360) which looks at "academia's slow adoption of new technologies for its own work." One of the strong points about electronic media, McPherson maintains, is the degree to which the user maintains control over the medium, even though that control is more "ideology than ontology." In otherwords, user control over digital media is more perception and thought than an actuality.




But I would argue that, in fact, electronic media does increasingly gives users control over how they use that media. More than perception, recent developments in new media give users the ability to subscribe to content, publish and comment on that content themselves, and participate in a broad community of authoring and sharing information.




It seems like an interesting negotiation among all interested parties: Publishers, authors, institutions, readers...who should have the most control, and why? And at what cost? It seems like, within academia, the higher the level of control given to publishers and institutions over a publication, the more that publication is "worth" in terms of authority. In contrast, the more control given to authors and readers over a publication, the less that publication is worth. This doesn't quite make sense to me; maybe I'm being to simplistic. Maybe this is one reason academics, particularly historians, are reluctant to adopt electronic forms of scholarly publication. But it seems that academics need to address issues of control and issues of professional "worth" of publications as we move further along in the digital age.
