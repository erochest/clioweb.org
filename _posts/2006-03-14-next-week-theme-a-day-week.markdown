Inspired by Phu Ly's [Theme A Day](http://ifelse.co.uk/archives/2006/02/21/a-theme-a-day/) week for Wordpress, I decided to do my own. Was going to do it this week, but work and school projets take a higher priority right now. So hopefully next week I'll start my Theme-A-Day. LI've got two decent history-based themes, and one pretty simple theme. If you have any requests for the two remaining themes, pass them along.
