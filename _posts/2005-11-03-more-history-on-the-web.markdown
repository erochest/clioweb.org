[Evolution of the Skyscraper](http://skyscraperpage.com/diagrams/?2337084), a diagram comparing skyscrapers since 1908.




The Civil Defense Museum has a page on [fallout shelter signs](http://www.civildefensemuseum.com/signs/).




[Making Sense of Marcel Duchamp](http://www.understandingduchamp.com/index.html). Not sure if that's possible, but this site helps a little.




[New York Changing](http://www.newyorkchanging.com/imagelist.html) is a website that juxtaposts photos of New York from the 1930s with photos from today. Interesting to see what has changed and what hasn't.
