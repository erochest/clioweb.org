As the crew from [Digital Campus](http://digitalcampus.tv) [have](http://www.dancohen.org/2008/01/18/that-podcast-launches/) [already](http://edwired.org/?p=267) [announced](http://www.foundhistory.org/2008/01/25/that-podcast/), [Dave Lester](http://davelester.org) and I published our [first episode](http://thatpodcast.org/episodes/wordpress/) of our new podcast, [THATPodcast](http://thatpodcast.org). The first show focused on [WordPress](http://wordpress.org), and included an interview with [Matt Mullenweg](http://ma.tt), the creator of WordPress, and a screencast covering our plugin [ScholarPress Courseware](http://scholarpress.net/courseware/).





Even though I had taken a [digital history documentary](http://www.archiva.net/hist615ay04/) class a few years ago, it still surprised me how much work creating a podcast involved. Like Dave, though, I'm pretty happy with what we came up with, despite getting a little rushed. Dave did a lot of work at the end, so most of the credit for the success of the first show should go to him. Thanks, Dave.





Our plan is to roll out a new [THATPodcast](http://thatpodcast.org) show once a month. In February our show will cover [Omeka](http://omeka.org), the free, open source platform for managing collections and exhibits now in development at the [Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu). We're going to time episode two with the public release of [Omeka](http://omeka.org), so be sure to check back next month!
