Spurred by the recent comment by Virginia senator George Allen that Republicans must continue to adhere to "[common-sense Jeffersonian conservative principles](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120301347_pf.html)" to be successful, the [VA-HIST listserv lit up like a volcano](http://listlva.lib.va.us/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A1=ind0512&L=va-hist). VA-HIST is the email listserv for Virginia history, run by the Library of Virginia. Some very interesting discussion, including Jefferson on slavery and religious freedom, most of which has yet to be resolved.
