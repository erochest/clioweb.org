Among the other things I've been doing is the redesign of the [Western Civilization Webography](http://chnm.gmu.edu/webography/index.htm) project. While it will be a little while longer before the new site goes live, here's a little sneak-preview of what's to come.

**Update:** For some reason the rest of this didn't get published with my original post. My install of [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org) has been acting a little funky lately.




For those of you not familiar with the Webography project, it was started by Dr. T. Mills Kelly, associate professor of history and art history at GMU and associate director of the [Center for History and New Media](http://chnm.gmu.edu). Basically, the site is a collection of student and teacher reviews of websites that cover Western Civilization history. A number of Western Civ classes in the United States and other parts of the world have used the site as part of their coursework. It's a useful tool for students and educators alike.
