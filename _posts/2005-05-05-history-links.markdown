[How to Perform Strong Man Stunts](http://www.sandowplus.co.uk/Competition/Coulter/Stunts/stunts-intro.htm) -- Published in 1956. My favorite lines: "These stunts will make you the life of the party, as well as greatly admired. At the same time, the fun you enjoy from these performances will build your body stronger and peppier, giving you a never-ending thrill in your increasing might and muscle."




[They Still Draw Pictures](http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/speccoll/tsdp/) -- The University of California at San Diego's Special Collections site on children's drawings from the Spanish Civil War. I'll probably review this site further after I look at it more closely.




[ Trousers tell why Napoleon Died](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/4512289.stm) -- From the BBC news.




[The women's petition against coffee (1674)](http://staff-www.uni-marburg.de/~gloning/wom-pet.htm) -- Not sure if this is a real document or a forgery...does anyone else know? It's amusing either way.
