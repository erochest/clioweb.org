Ya gotta love web and graphic designers. Read a bunch of 'em arguing at Microsoft's Internet Explorer 7 developer's blog about the [orange icon](http://blogs.msdn.com/rssteam/archive/2005/10/08/478505.aspx). To me, the argument against putting the letters "RSS" in a feed icon is wrong. It's condescending toward users and leads to using icons that fail to convey what the icon stands for.
