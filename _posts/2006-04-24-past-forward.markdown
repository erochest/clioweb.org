The AAHC is currently having its annual conference. [Sheila Brennan](http://clioweb.org/sheila/), [Stephanie Hurter](http://wordchoice.org), and I have a virtual panel entitled ["Past/Forward: Collecting, Teaching, and Writing History (in the Digital Universe)"](http://past-forward.org). If you have time, please visit the panel, read our presentations, and offer comments along the way. The conference goes from April 24-April 27, but our panel is open to the public and will be up long after the conference ends.
