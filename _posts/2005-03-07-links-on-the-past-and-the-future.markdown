[The Internet Revolution has Little to do with Technology.](http://actsofvolition.com/archives/2005/march/theinternet) -- Steve Garrity on how the internet is a participatory medium, one that requires some thought and input on the user's end. "...when you look at some of the fundamental ideas behind the web, a system where the power lies at the ends and there is no real centralization, it is easy to see how this could affect your general mindset." Another quote: "They have access to the producers of much of the media they consume. In many cases the word _consume_ is inadequate to describe the activity and _participate_ may be a better term." I still wonder how much people actually _participate_ on the web, but the differentiation between participation and consumption is something I'd like to explore in more depth.
