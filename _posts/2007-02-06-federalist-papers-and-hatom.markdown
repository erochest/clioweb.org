Edward O'Connor has marked up the [Federalist Papers](http://federali.st/) in hAtom. Nice choice for a domain name, too. O'Connor has linked various papers from the Federalist Papers together, and has also linked the papers to the Constitution, Articles of Confederation, and the Declaration of Independence.
