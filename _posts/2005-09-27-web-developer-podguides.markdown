[Jeremy Keith's](http://adactio.com/) [reference section to _DOM Scripting_](http://domscripting.com/book/podbook/) and WestCiv's [Stylemaster Podguide](http://www.westciv.com/news/podguide.html), both available for download to put in your iPod's Notes folder. Ah, now when I'm riding the bike at the gym I can read about DOM scripting and CSS in addition to my notes on history books (which I do already, and it's kinda handy).
