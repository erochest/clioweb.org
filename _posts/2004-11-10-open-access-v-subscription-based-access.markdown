I found an article on [America: History and Life](http://serials.abc-clio.com/) (requires subscription) that I wanted. There were three links to the article. One took me to [Ingenta](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/searching/Expand?token=005a1e18264060d919b3976d6222646b66602530332976335a666f3a7b2f2a31386f2c6b744c23762a9a51cc51&pub=infobike://carfax/chjf/2001/00000021/00000003/art00003), where the article would cost me about $23. Another link took me to [Taylor and Francis](http://taylorandfrancis.metapress.com/app/home/contribution.asp?wasp=chbdh0pqqp3yxnfbek0j&referrer=parent&backto=issue,3,7;journal,13,23;linkingpublicationresults,1:102216,1), where I could download the article for free.




Which do you think I chose?




**Update:** I realized after I posted that [GMU](http://www.gmu.edu) subscribes to Taylor and Francis, so it might not actually be free for non-GMU users. So, this probably wasn't the best example of Open-access versus subscription-based access. If fact, I know it wasn't. Nevertheless, because I honor the idea that blog entries must remain published after the fact, I keep my oversight online and available to all who wish to criticize.
