Since I found out a way to write a script that will allow me (and other users) to switch the style sheets on my website, I've been working on a new design. I haven't written the script yet, and I don't have all of my pages linked to the new style sheet, so my pages will probably look different from each other in the next few days. Hopefully I'll finish the new design, write the script, and decide on which one I want to make the default. I'm leaning more towards the new one, since it's a "minimal" design, and I'm a minimal kind of guy. This will actually come in pretty handy, since I plan to change my site's design to coincide with various historical themes (i.e. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, Women's History Month).




I start back to work tomorrow, and I'm really looking forward to it. I'll be going to a workshop given by [Paula](http://www.archiva.net) on the uses of weblogs for history classrooms and the [History 120 modules](http://chnm.gmu.edu/history120/). In the meantime, the details for [Digital History Documentary](http://www.archiva.net/hist615ay04/) look nice.
