Now that the semester is winding down I've been exploring some potential topics for my dissertation. All of them will, more than likely, focus on nineteenth-century U.S., and none of them (as far as I know) will discuss segregation law. I've been doing work on segregation law for about two years now, and while I still think more work can be done on the history of segregation, I'm a little eager to branch out (even slightly). Part of my hesitation to move away from segregation history is a matter of comfort: I'm familiar with the historiography on race and segregation, so doing a different topic requires that I move somewhat out of my comfort zone. But I need to move out of my comfort zone.




My first idea, and the one I'm leaning toward most, is doing something on the history of privacy. [Tom Ewing](http://www.history.vt.edu/Ewing/Index.htm), a history professor from [Virginia Tech](http://www.history.vt.edu), suggested that I look into it, and the readings that I've been doing as part of my cultural history minor have been relevant to the topic.




Another idea for my dissertation is a historical analysis of cleanliness and filth in the nineteenth century. I noticed that as I found early twentieth-century newspaper articles espousing the virtues of pure white blood, I also found beside those articles advertisements for medicines that would "purify and cleanse the blood." It seemed an interesting and paradoxical juxtaposition of natural white purity and medical, scientific means of purifying the body. I think a look at ideas of purity would be one aspect of many that made up America's infatuation with cleanliness and filth.




I'd also like to do some work on the emergence of the celebrity in the nineteenth century. I've always been interested in the way people become celebrities and how people promote or publicize themselves as celebrities, so it seemed like an interesting topic to pursue.




Of course, I'll probably end up exploring all of these topics in one way or another in my dissertation, whichever one I finally decide to do. A history of privacy would benefit from a discussion on how a celebrity's private life was used to promote a play or book. Similarly, one could make the argument that "privacy" in the nineteenth century emerged as a way to hide yet legitimate "dirty" taboo, or transgressive behavior.




I still have to do a lot of exploratory research before deciding on a final topic, but I feel confident in having a few choices. I've started readings lists on all of these topics, but if you have any suggestions for readingprimary and/or secondary sourcesfeel free to throw them my way.
