# About

I am the Design Architect for Digital Research and Scholarship in the [Scholars’ Lab][scholars-lab], at the [University of Virginia Library][uva-library].

I am also an ABD in [History][gmu-history] at [George Mason University][gmu]. My dissertation, entitled “The Designing Historian,” explores design as a methodology for doing digital history. My other research interests include the history of design, the history of technology, and social/cultural history.
