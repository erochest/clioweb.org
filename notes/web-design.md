# Web Design

Some notes about web design. Links to things and such.

The only thing I'm really certain of about my web design process is that
it's iterative; there are no really hard and fast rules to follow. For
me, each design project is unique, and should be appreciated as such. They are
opportunities to learn and grow, and to do the best I can with the
time, resources, and information I have at the moment.

Typography, color, size, texture, layout, all will become your tools for
communicating ideas that support your projects content and overall
message. You should learn to use these, appreciate these, and watch for
how these are used all around you. If you're fortunate enough to get to do this
for a living, you'll get better at it with each project. Know and understand that
you can get better, but enjoy your work while you're doing it.

## Learning Web Design and User Experience

* No amount of book-learnin' will take the place of you actually
practicing design.
* Design is not about "I like X"; It's about "I think X helps accomplish
your goals or enforces your message."
* Notice stuff more: Critique the design of things. Everything. Ask
why it's designed the way it is, and what might change if it were
designed a different way.
* Maintaining inspiration files
	* Keep an album of screenshots. [Little

	* Physical inspiration file - Box full of stuff I think is interesting.
	* Keeping up with design community/design work.
* Draw more. You can draw. Yes, you really can. Draw more. Lots more.

* Drawing lots of ideas, and refine from there.

## Working with Content

Design should support the content or service you're providing. So it
makes it pretty important to actually have content to work with, or at least an idea
about what content will be available and when.

## Wireframing

Wireframing should provide enough details to decide on the relationships
between, and importance of, all the content on your web page.

* Question whether you need to do them at all.
* Quick and dirty versus slow and refined?
  * Hand-drawn are quick, easy, and lower investment for making
decisions and moving on.
  * More refined, formalized wireframes seem good for presenting to
stakeholders for decisions and discussion.

## Mockups and design proposals

I used to like doing different design concepts for a single project,
like doing 3-4 mockups for a client or team to choose from. I think
there's a problem with that approach, though, because it felt like a
shotgun approach to design, hoping that one of them hit on what the team
or client was looking for. Instead, I try to get whoever's involved in
the design decisions and ask them what kind of emotions or reactions they'd
like the project to evoke, what kind of ways they'd want to describe
feel of the site, adn try to come up with one design proposal that
accomplishes that and refine from there.

* Mood boards - Collage of images, text, whatever, that try to evoke a
certain mood. Use these to get a gauge on how you and your team would
like to shape the aesthetic direction of a project.
  * Get team/stakeholders involved. Have them help make them.
* Working mockups - Image Editor versus HTML/CSS?
